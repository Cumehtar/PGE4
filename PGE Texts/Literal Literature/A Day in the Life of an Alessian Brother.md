A Documentation of an Ayleid Communication Spell, And a Conversation Afterwards by the Alessian Assistant Magistrate of Lower [[Kvatch]]. 

*\[I had the idea to write a sort of day-in-the-life exchange of (Neo? not sure I understand the terminology) Alessianists. I hope it's ok\]*

*As his comrades stand around him, an Altmer once again casts his spell while attempting to not lash out at their mockery.*

*"HELLO?"*

*On the other end, a Colovian sips his tankard of imported Honningbrew while staring at an empty hologram stand.*

*"Be quiet, you fools! "*

*And once more, the spell is cast*

*"Hello?!"*

*Finally. The Colovian stands and approaches the purplish hologram.*

*"Hello!"*

*The Altmer stares along with all the others at the suddenly appearing hologram.*

*'H-Hello? Can you hear us? Hello?'*

*Silence.*

*"Can you hear me?"*

*A Breton soldeir shoves the Altmer aside.*

*"Let me handle this, Elf, it just needs a little push."*

*He puts aside his cheap wine bottle and kicks the Hologram stand.*  
*Suddenly, the purple hologram flails around wildly all over the room, and all the men throw themselves backwards in fright.*

*The Altmer quickly attunes himself to continue maintaining the spell, and it turns back on.*

*"Can you hear us now?"*

*"Yes! I can hear you! Can you hear me?"*

*"We can hear you, yes! I-"*

*And then, the Hologram turns off.*

*"Fuck!" Says the Altmer, as he turns around and looks at the terrified Breton. "What have you done?"*

*"Well, it worked for a moment, d-didn't it?" Says the cowed Breton*

*"And then it broke! Now my spell isn't even working!"*

*"It's not my fault that you failed college."*

*A fight breaks out.*

*On the other end, a Colovian sips from his tankard.*

*"Huh. Are you recording all this, Alessander?"*

*He sits back down.*

*"Of course I am." I said as I dipped my quill in ink once again "This is potentially groundbreaking."*

*"Well, Assistant Magistrate," Says the Colovian "If you find an Elf, grown even for his race if I may, failing to cast a spell 'groundbreaking', then I don't share your optimism." He breathed and continued "Before I go back to Cheydinhal, ask the Chaplin to keep working on it. It's a rare day when we find functioning Ayleid spells, and though I doubt we'll ever find the complete version of this spell, or that we, us poor fellow soldiers of St. Alessia will finish what the Ayleids didn't, it's better than doing nothing."*

*"Yes," I replied "However, recall the records of long-distance communications we have already recovered in the newly uncovered parts of Vilverin during the last secret incursion. We know it existed, at least."*

*The Colovian turned and said, "Once again. We're not the Ayleids."*

*"Don't be so modest." I said, "We have Herself on our side."*

*The Colovian got up "It is time for me to go."*

*"Very well." I rose, "Let us pray."*

*As he was the senior, he led the prayer, starting with the Admission of Mortality*

*"By the grace of the covenant, I turn to those superior. May you deem it fit to send us bounties fruitful, and may our transgressions not pierce your domains. For we are mortals, and you are not, and when we die, you remain." He then continued with the Alessian Creed. "O' Blessed St. Alessia, El-Estia, Queen-ut-Cyrod, pray for us slaving mortals and sinners as you prayed for your people's liberty and as Akatosh delivered. For we will eternally honor her covenant,* ***Ae'malatu."***

*He got up. "Are you writing this down too?"*

*"Why, yes of course." I replied "For protocol. Also, I will tell the Chaplain of your request, though I am sure this will be continued to be studied for eons."*

*"...Okay. I'm going now. Farewell." He said, backing away towards the door.*

*"Have a safe journey back to Cheydinhal, Inspector. I am sorry we disappointed with the research regarding the Ayleid spell."*

*"Yes, thank you."*

*"May her covenant sow your path."*
