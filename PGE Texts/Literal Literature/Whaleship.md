Orakh waited for the dawn.

Strictly speaking, the wait was unnecessary. Only in the earliest days of whaleship travel were the explorers forced to await the sun’s rays and the flood of magical energy they brought, eagerly eking out every drop of power that could be captured by the aetherial nets. No, in the here and now, the vast reservoirs of energy that had been collected over decades, pooled in circuits hidden in the mountains, let the whaleships travel whenever and wherever the Orcs of Orsinium desired.

Yet there was value in tradition.

So Orakh sat, back against the cool stone of the whalehouse, and breathed deeply, awaiting the dawn.

“Ten crates of Sanguine Bloodwine, and whatever else we can get our hands on.” Moth, the whaleship’s navigator, lowered the wine-stained scrap of parchment. “The weather in Port Katariah must be awful if they’re going through it this fast.”

“When is the weather not awful?” Orakh snorted. “Normal pay rate?”

“Aye.” Moth tucked the parchment away in his belt.  “We should start charging more if they keep demanding this much.” Short for an Orc, Moth’s skin was pale, as much from his Colovian ancestry as from his life spent underground in the tunnels and bunkers. Nonetheless, Orakh had never known a navigator as skilled or steady-handed, nor a mind so perceptive as Moth’s. “Is the rest of the crew here yet?”

“Suiting up as we speak.”

“Good.” Moth raised a hand to caress the ebony amulet hanging around his neck. “Well, let’s get to it, shall we?”
