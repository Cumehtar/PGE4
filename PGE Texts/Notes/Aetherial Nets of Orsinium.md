*The many mountainsides of the Great Free City of Orsinium are adorned with multitudes of nets, woven of silk and hemp and supported by frames of wood and orichalcum. These nets have no discernable mundane purpose - while visitors have often seen the Orcs shaking them out and repairing them, they have never seen them used for anything.*

*However, study by visiting mages has begun to reveal a pattern in how the nets are organized, corresponding to the paths of the sun, wind currents, the streams of aetherial energy, and the phases of the moon. In short, it is believed that Orsinium's nets are an intricate, elaborate system of magicka collection, concentration, and redirection - but for what purpose? A navigation aid, for the fabled whaleships? A powerful orrery? Something more nefarious? With such confounding barbarians, anything is possible.*

*The nets are for collecting water. That's it. Maybe if the mages could pull their heads out of their asses they'd realize not everything has a mystic explanation. - YgM*
