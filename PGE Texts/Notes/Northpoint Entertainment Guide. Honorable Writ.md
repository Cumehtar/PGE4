If venturing to Northpoint in the summer months, the editors would like to recommend looking for when the Northpoint Players will be performing Honorable Writ. The playwright, so far, has remained anonymous, perhaps out of safety concerns. All the notable Dunmeri Houses are represented in this play that claims to detail out some Morag Tong assassinations of an earlier era, prior to the fall of Baar Dau. While I have not talked to any scholars on whether the details are at all accurate to any point in time in Vvardenfell, the acting and use of illusionary spellcraft works well with the subject matter.
