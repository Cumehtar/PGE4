*The militia known as the "Valtheim Shipburners" claims the dubious distinction - honor, in their words - of being Snow-Throat's oldest commissioned militia, older than the nation itself. The militia traces its roots to the last days of the old Whiterun Hold and the first days of the Silver Plague, when Jarl Balgruuf the Greater of Whiterun ordered the closure of the White River in an attempt to stop the spread of the plague upriver. Asking for volunteers from the guards and citizens of the city, the Jarl ordered the assembled force to occupy the portaging station of Valtheim Towers, patrol the riverbanks, and burn any ships that refused to turn back.*

*The newly created force apparently took to this task with a suspicious fervor, clearing out - or possibly recruiting - the itinerants who had taken up residence in Valtheim Towers, setting up a command structure independent of the now-nonexistent Jarl, and capturing herds of cattle, sheep, and goats to set loose on the pastures surrounding the towers, as well as almost gleefully setting fire to ships attempting passage upstream. While ultimately unsuccessful at stopping the spread of the Plague, the actions of the Shipburners managed to delay it, giving the people of Whiterun a chance to flee the city.*

*Within the first two years of the Plague, the ranks of the Shipburners had swelled from a paltry two dozen to nearly two hundred, reinforced by exiles from Whiterun and Dunmer refugees from Eastmarch and the Rift. The core of this militia remained the initial volunteers, having been elected to ranks of officers, but supplemented by newly-formed cadres of mages, alchemists, smiths, and stewards. The Towers gradually became something of a safe haven on the White River - albeit one with a dangerous reputation among river-boat crews - providing a small island of stability and order.*

*In 4e231, as the Plague began to recede, the Shipburners sent a delegation to the Hold Moot in Whiterun. Consisting of the few original members and newly-recruited officers, the militia secured a position for itself in the newly-reformed Whiterun Hold: an officially sponsored and approved military organization responsible for policing the area surrounding Valtheim Towers. The militia would in theory be subservient to the Hold Moot and elected Jarl, but would have a degree of independence and leeway in recruitment, organization, and election of officers not present in the old days. Since then, the militia has served capably, primarily protecting the portaging paths, riverbanks, and surrounding communities. The militia has never quite shook the reputation of being overzealous hooligans - and indeed, they seem to encourage it, proudly wearing badges and flying banners depicting burning ships framed by Valtheim Towers.*
