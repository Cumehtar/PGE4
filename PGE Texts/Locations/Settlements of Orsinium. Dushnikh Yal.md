*[[Dushnikh Yal]] is a border town of the [[Free City of Orsinium]], and likely the only settlement of [[Orsinium]] most outsiders will ever see. Built in the foothills of the Druadach mountains, Dushnikh Yal is the primary point of entry to Orsinium east of the mountains, servicing traders from the Reach, Colovia, Greater Wrothgar & Karth, and Snow-Throat.*

*Built in the traditional style of strongholds, central Dushnikh Yal consists of several longhouses that serve as both lodging and warehouses, surrounded by a stone wall of carved stones fitted without mortar. Outside of this wall are what is typically referred to as the "trader's grounds" - relatively flat areas in which trade caravans may pitch their tents, park their wagons, and put horses, oxen, and mammoths to pasture. Trade of goods is relegated to the marketplace, where Orcish ceramics, metalworks, hides, and more esoteric goods may be bought and contracts with Orcish smiths and stonemasons signed.*

*For any who wish to travel deeper into Orsinium, guides must be found and hired, as outsiders are not permitted free access to the city-state. Wagons must be exchanged, as Orsinium's roads are inset with grooves of a certain width to help ensure that no carts slip off the cobbles - a safety measure for those paths that travel along cliffsides and gorges.*

*Straying from the roads on the approach to Dushnikh Yal or wandering from the trader's grounds is heavily disadvised. [[Airships]] anchored among the crags host heavily armed and armored guards, who will forcefully arrest and expel wanderers or pass word along to the chief of the town. Attempting to enter Dwemer ruins without explicit permission will be met with a swift execution, as Orsinium has no prisons.*
