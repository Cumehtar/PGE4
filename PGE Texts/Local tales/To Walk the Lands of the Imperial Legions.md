Come, walk Colovia.

No, we speak not of the Estates. Let them hide behind their walls. Mage-ruled, madman-ruled, bulls and brass and broken dreams. Come. We walk the wilds.

A day? No, the Estates still claim that land. Their towns hold close, scared and stifled. Leave them behind.

A week? Perhaps. Let the moons dance the dragon. We walk.

Set foot upon the steppe, wild and windswept. Scars sink deep here - scars of empire, scars of war, scars of sickness. Ruins of towns scatter the wilds - out here, things do not decay, no, not enough rain for that. They dry, and persist, waiting. Set foot in them if you wish, see the past. Villas burned in battles of mage and men, temples bereft of altars, wells run dry. Touch not the bones of the dead - the talons of the Taskmaster sleep deep, waiting, waiting. Take not the treasure, for silver is the color of death.

But leave those behind. No, we are not here for them. Let the dead rest.

We seek the living. Oh, the Company men and women? With their stolen souls in brass bodies, shepherded from site to site? No, best to avoid them. Prying eyes are eyes they despise - and shut, for ever and ever.

We seek the copses of trees, the rifts and runnels. Here life sings, and lows. Cattle and sheep and goats, herded from place to place by the Imperials.

You, girl. A Thane-Baron of Wrothgar, you say? Family elevated to the hill-forts of the Legion Road? Speak to them the Name and Number. You are kin, you see.

Man of the North, with frost in his veins. Who founded your band? What honors did they hold? Speak the Name and Number. You are kin, we see.

Orc with his sword. Tell them of the Seventh and the Fifteenth. You are their descendant, are you not? We are kin, we see.

We are the Imperial Legions, and our Empire is not one of land, nor of blood. Our empire is one of Memory and Bonds. We walk a land unclaimed, live in the ancient forts and camps. Hawkmoth, Moonmoth, the Deathsheads, the Fifth, the Seventh, the Fifteenth, the Eighteenth, the Stormed Cloaks, Tullius’ Host, these and many more. We are kin, you see, here in this consecrated wilderness, there in the cities, there across the world. Our companies march forth, and our numbers grow, our empire of water.

Hush, now. The horsemen approach. They seek naught but to burn the world away. Let them pass, for now. Let our steel sing later.

Come, walk Colovia. Walk the lands of an empire unclaimed.
