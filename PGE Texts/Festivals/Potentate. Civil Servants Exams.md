Ninth of the Second Seed, as most of the readers should know, is the first day of the yearly Civil Servant Exams. On this day, any willing aspirant can contest for the lowest rank within the system that regulates day-to-day functioning of the [[Potentate]]. The entry fee of three silver [[Scales]] is not large enough to prohibit anyone from entering, but necessary to fund the organization and discourage frivolous engagement. Those with the ranks can use this as a chance to improve their position and gain the promotion, though the entry fee for them is higher.

All over the country - and especially in the Capital, where the exams for the highest ranks are held - the shrines of saints and minor gods are decorated with lavish gifts. The most popular are the shrines of those who grant success and hidden knowledge, among them the Saint of the Water Face, the Saint who Holds the Paper, Her of the Black Hands, the Wise Owl and Her of Dawn and Dusk.

While some of the contests, like written history or arithmetics exams, are held in quiet seclusion, many other, like poetry, archery, conjuration or theological debates, provide a public spectacle. It is not uncommon to see the lower classes start wagers on the highest and lowest scoring aspirants. This practice is officially not encouraged, but is not prohibited either.
