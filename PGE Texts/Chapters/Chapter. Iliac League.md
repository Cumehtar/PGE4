The densely populated region of the Iliac Bay was hit by the Plague almost as bad as Colovia, although the consequences for the region were slightly different.

Fiercely loyal to their cities, the urban inhabitants of the Bay didn't leave them for the countryside, as was the practice in the rest of the world. They hunkered down in their quarters, quarantined the segments of the city from each other, waited, and persisted.

The subsequent rebuilding efforts have, in no small terms, changed the world, and cemented the contemporary Iliac culture. The whole modern magical automation started with the Iliac Bay, when the survivors worked to keep up the old infrastructure that relied on the huge numbers of unqualified workers and laborers.

These early attempts were full of idiosyncratic tricks and thinking by similarity - souls of oxen put into the plows, souls of spiders used for the weaving machines. The contemporary research shows that sympathetic correspondence doesn't really work, and scale improves the performance much more. The Knights of the Bay insist on keeping their quaint practices of enchanting one tool at a time.

Knights, yes, time to speak of them. The people of the Iliac Bay, both the Bretons and the Forebears, always had a pretty peculiar attitude to nobility. While 'my ancestors were better than yours' attitude have always been there, reinforced by the Direnni influence, the recognition of individual worth and achieviment always was there as well. The survivor mentality post-Plague had swung the current attitude firmly into the meritocratic direction.

The Knights are usually not more than a half of urban population, but the Knight is what everyone strives to be. A warrior, a mage, a merchant, a politician, a poet - a Knight should be everything at once, while being fiercely loyal to both their family and their city. That some families are already richer and more powerful than the others, and would only continue to do so, have not yet become an obvious problem.

This peculiar attitude to power had hammered the last nail in the coffin of the culture of hereditary monarchy in the Bay. Whether it is true or not, the scholars of the Bay treat the very concept as an alien practice, imposed and reinforced by the meddling of the Remans and the Septims. Instead, each city keeps (and constantly invents) their own rules of electing temporary leaders in the open forums of the local Knight councils.

The League as a whole is organized the same way - ruled by the council if City representatives that gather once a decade on the Isle of Balfiera to elect the League leaders. The very location of the so-called 'capital', as well as the personalities of the leaders are the result of compromise between the traditionally strongest cities - Daggerfall and Sentinel.

Religiously, the Bay is just as fragmented as it is politically. Each city has its own Temple of the patron deity. Each Temple keeps its own counsel and its own interpretation of theology. Even the Septims didn't manage to impose the unified creed in the Bay, so the efforts of the Archdiocese are laughable in comparison.

There is also one more side to the Bay that is usually overlooked and forgotten. We can even say there are two states, two cultures sharing the same space without noticing each other. The whole knightly culture is concentrated in the cities, and the countryside is another thing entirely. Always ignored by the city-folk, the peasants and villagers of the Iliac Bay had also survived the Plague on their own, and formed their own set of fully diverging social practices.

The ages-old struggle between the Wyrd and the Druids takes place there. Small, hidden villages keep to themselves, and the stories told about them grow more fanciful day by day - they can turn into animals at will, they keep to their own version of the Green Pact, they *are* partially animals, with hooves, and antlers, and claws. Nonsense, obviously.
