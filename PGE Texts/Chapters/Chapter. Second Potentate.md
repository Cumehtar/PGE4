 While the purpose of this work always was informative and educational, it was never meant to cover the history of our homeland. Yet after careful consideration the Editorial Board decided to give the Potentate the same treatment as the foreign kingdoms. ^1 After all, some of the readers may be unfamiliar with their own history, or this book will spread beyond our borders and serve as a guide for foreigners as well.

When has our polity started is not a question that has a straightforward answer. Some of our institutions date back to the First Era. A significant cultural substrate is Nibenese, unchanged for millennia, and now exerting a considerable influence on the religious practices. An Akaviri revival and a discovery of the Remanian archives brought back the fragments of history abandoned since the First Era.

A literalist historian would say, though, that the Potentate had started in the year 218, when the extended Elder Council first reconvened in the city of Cheydinhal and stepped on the path of restoring the Nibenay from the destruction wrought by the Second Great War, the civil war and the still ongoing plague. However controversial the last Mede emperor, Albertius, may have been, his [[Restoration of the Guilds Act]] has laid the foundations of Potentate's political system. Not a barbarous rule by the mob, and not restricted only to the arbitrarily defined nobility, the current [[Elder Council]] consists of both the members of ancient honorable Councilor families,^2 and the Guldmasters of all formerly Imperial Guilds ^3 who bring to the table much-needed voice of the working people.

Other states can only envy the stability of such a structure, headed and moderated by the Potentate, an elected position.^4 The laws issued are the finest example of nuanced regulations that take into account the conflicting interests of all the factions and take the course that would be the best for all - think only about the Souls Edict, that so handily resolved all the issues concerning black soul gem trade and industrialized enchantment.^5 The day-to-day functioning of the state is carried by the meritocracy of the [[civil servants]], the highly educated bureaucrats that are selected and promoted through the regularly held public exams.^6

Having this brief introduction behind us, we will now guide you through the tourist and business attractions of our homeland. River Niben continues to dominate and define the region, and the multitude of small rivers flowing into it support numerous villages and towns. The land that was allowed to lie fallow and grow over with forests in the Septim times is back in use, and rice fields with their irrigation systems, channels, and gates are a prominent feature of the landscape as they once were.

Bigger cities of the region act as the hubs of trade, religion, and education, each of them special and famous in its own way. [[Cheydinhal]], the capital, had grown enormously in the last centuries. Old city walls surround what now feels like a quaint city center,^7 while the city proper spreads now far beyond them on both banks of the Corbolo River. Building programs, variously sponsored by the state or by the more prosperous business owners, allowed to house all the workforce the city needs.^8

[[Bravil]] is most famous as a site of religious pilgrimages. Petitioners from all over Tamriel come to beg Her Saints for intervention or offer their thanks, and the sermons of the Primates attract the most diverse crowd.

Kragenmoor guards the passage over the Velothi mountains. In the times almost forgotten it was a center of Dres agriculture. Now, ironically, the city that once supplied most of Cyrodiil with saltrice depends on the Nibenese rice shipments itself. The ash that choker its fields is, conversely, one of the biggest exports, as it is used not only in alchemy, but as a component of new building materials.

If you want to see the center of modern agriculture, look no further than [[Cropsford]]. Modern plantations, worked by the enchanted automatae, far surpass the productivity of anything that came before, and, fortunately, they weren't affected by the recent Souls Edict restrictions. ^9

[[Ione]] lives up to the glory of the Legion Captain Tertius Ione it was named after. Once a tiny village, now it is the home to the most sizable Legion garrison. Their pikes stopped countless Bjoulsae incursions. Add irregular auxiliaries, mercenaries, and the traders plying the overland routes, and it makes for a lively, yet raunchy and somewhat dangerous city.

If Ione attracts the most hardy and risky merchants that dare to brave the Bjoulsae steppes, [[Rimmen]] lies on the safer trade paths that go through [[Wiki/Polities/Anequina]]. As a saying goes, 'you can get anything in Rimmen for the right price'. Even if it hints at the old racist sentiment towards our Khajiiti countrymen, the display of goods - legally - traded in Rimmen is impressive. Most of the moon-sugar and its derivatives that are so in demand for various rituals reach the Potentate through Rimmen.

[[Gwylim]] has always been famous for its university. But what had been a small institution devoted to deeply arcane pursuits have become, with [[Synod]]'s sponsorship, a center of modern learning. Only the [[University of Cheydinhal]] can equal it, but the foundations of modern soul science in the Potentate were laid down in the [[University of Gwylim]]. The accurate measurement of soul gem capacity, the methodology of astral navigation, even the translation of Remanian archives come from there.

Last but not the least, [[Port Katariah]]. The black gem of the Topal Bay, it is the greatest shipyard and harbor of the modern world. 

*^1 Meaning Helseth cashed out and they scrambled*

*^2 Translation: Nibenese oligarchs whose ancestors bought that position in the time of one mad Septim or another*

*^3 Fat cats that bribe and maneuver to get to the top of their respective Guilds - but also honest people among them, fortunately*

*^4 That have been held by one Helseth Hlaalu for more than a century and a half as of now*

*^5 Oh, yes, the riots and the strikes of 397 were glorious, the union of the laborers guilds paralyzed the whole country for weeks, pity they have decided not to push their luck and accepted the economic concessions*

*^6 Translation: Helseth's faithful dogs that owe their positions to him only; unless you think those essays on Akaviri poetry are honestly evaluated*

*^7 Meaning the villas and the mansions of the rich, the Palace and the Temple*

*^8 Cramped 'islands' are bad enough, but the Potentate-built arcologies started decaying decades after they were built; unlike the ones in Port Katariah, those were done by the lowest bidder*

*^9 Oh, how I hope that it will be affected - the farmers are fighting to be recognized as a Guild, and we are centrally going to have new strikes soon until they are; and [[Syffim]] will make sure that EEC thugs won't touch anyone this time*
