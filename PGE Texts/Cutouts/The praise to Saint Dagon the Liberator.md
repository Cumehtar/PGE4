*A crude pamphlet, very cheaply printed on the roughest paper, is tucked between the pages of this copy of the Guide.*

Razor-fed, blood-stained, divided, freed, we raise our voices in thanks to Lord Dagon! Nu-mantia! Liberty! 

By his power and his holy machinations, have the snake-chains been broken. Long had the coiled time tyrant grown his twin heads, each time double the number. Rejoice how they fall one by one - first the golden one, then the human one, the black one, and the avian.

Be glad that the nails affixing our world to the firmament are extracted. What they call the towers we can the adamantine spikes that stretched the living skin in the shape of the wheel.

Everywhere is the mark of His burning foot, by His burning hand have the mothers been slain, and people of the Elhnofey are free to change their shapes at last.

In the east, the cat-folk grow gray fur and boast red eyes. The men of Niben speak with the forked tongues. The tribes of the north drink sujamma-mead and shout ice and ash. The pirates of the south show feline grace on the deck. The knights of the west hold the spells of the Direnni in one hand and the spirit-swords of Yokuda in the other. And the horse-men of the River complete his glorious work, bringing fire and steel on feet and hoof.

Liberty! Freedom! Flame! Steel! The children of the mutant, ever mutable, came to take their own. Palaces broken, kings killed, temples ruined, gods exiled - look at the cleansing flames of the new world and rejoice.

Go! GHARTOK AL MNEM! God is come! NUMI MORA! NUM DALAE MNEM!
