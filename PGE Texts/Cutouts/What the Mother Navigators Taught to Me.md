*Ah, little cub, has it really been so long that you do not remember your Mothers? Tava-Khenarthi does not forget you, no matter what skin you wear now. I wish you would peel this skin off, though. Ruby does not suit you. Ah well. Var var var.*

*Is life in the big cities really a reward? For you, or your new clan bosses? Do you tire of pushing and pushing and only the top cat gets the sugar? Oh, yes, [[Cheydinhal]] “Society.” They are scholars, yes? Who only learn secrets the gray one wants them to know. And you have* sponsors, little cub? *So important. The Company will be very fair to us, I am sure.  But I will play your little game, for now.*

*The Alik’r is older than all of us. You would walk it safely? Talk to the [[Mother-Navigators]]. They taste the sugars, speak to the wind, and read the stars. You cannot learn from a book. You must Walkabout for a while. Walk until the sands burn to glass and you see your true reflection. Then you find the Far Dunes.*

*Jone and Jode circle each other. Satak and Akel eat each other. Khenarthi and Tava embrace as lovers, four-winged and two-headed. Do you understand yet? You cannot walk alone. That is how Sep gets you, Dark Heart hungrier than the Void. Join the caravan. We make a special trip, same low price.*

*The Colovian Highlands? Dangerous place. Tread at night, in the moonlit path. Horsemen might take you otherwise. Avoid the vampire’s city. That logic is for the silly men of the Ruby. Stock up at the [[Gottlesfont]], say a prayer to the winds. Look for the Serpent in the sky, see which way it’s pointing. What Satakal wills is willed.*

*You get near [[Dunei]]… I will not speak of that. Some things must be learned from others. Var var var. Follow the wind. It will always lead you back to where you began. See now? Jonenjode. Satakal. Khenarthi-Tava. Never go alone, unless you like being serpent-food. Tell that to your masters, little cub.*

"*I don't care if she* is *family, you must be touched by Sheogorath if you think we can print a word of this, Ammed. Even if we censor the insults toward the people paying for this guide, it's a bunch of mystical guarshit. Find a source who doesn't eat moon sugar like candy.*"
