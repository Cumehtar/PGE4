*The Wind District of the city of Whiterun is split by a bitter, simmering divide: to the west of the Gildergreen lies the temple of Kyne, Lady of Storms, Tear-Mother of the world, honorable warrior and hunter. To the east lies the hall of Jorrvaskr, and the savage Hunt.*

*Hides are stretched across the ancient timbers, trophies of horn and hair and bone and bronze dangle from rawhide strips. A clever eye could see the manner of beast these come from - beast, man and mer.*

*The interior is no better than the exterior. The main hall is dark and smoky, a fire smouldering in the hearth. Totems of bone and stone line the walls, smeared darkly. The tables and benches are rough-hewn timber padded with fur, the plates and cups plundered from tombs. The living quarters are like a beast's den - comforting for the creators, suffocating for all others.*

*A brawl has broken out. Knives flash, blood splashes. The wounded staggers away, and silver eyes watch eagerly - has the hunter become the hunted?*

*See these silver-eyed hunters. See their armor, leather and fur and plunder. See the weapons of iron and bone and stone - crude, yes, but sharp and savage. See the way they eye one another - is this your brotherhood, my young hunter? Is this the kinship you seek?*

*Beware, my young hunter. Beware the Hunt. Remember, my young hunter, that someday the hunt must end.*
