*The silence is deafening as you walk the streets of White-Gold. Once the heart of Empires, see the city now - silent, slow, waiting.*

*Walk the streets. The towers lie abandoned, vines crawling their sides. Walk the streets. The arena is quiet - no adoring fans throng the seats. Walk the streets. The trees have grown, dwarfing the courtyards they root in.*

*This way. Let us leave behind the empty streets. The city is not quite abandoned, no, not yet. The faithful yet live here. Which ones? Why, all of them. This is the city of a thousand cults, you know. A thousand cults, and each with their own little domain, eking out a life in the houses-turned-gardens, the sewers, the guardposts...*

*But only one matters, yes? And that one is the one whom the dragons worship.*

*So speaks the One, the Ruling King...*
