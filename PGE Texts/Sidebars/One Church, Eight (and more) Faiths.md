The Cyrodiilic (or Alessian or, formerly, Imperial) Cult has always been a union of eight (and occasionally nine) Churches within one shared roof. Over the ages, its structure and hierarchies have remained surprisingly constant: at the top are the Primates (also known as Archbishops) of each Divine, gathered in the Council of Eight. Each Primate command the Patriarchs and Matriarchs (also known as high bishops) who manage the Faith in a given nation by directing the Masters (bishops) of the larger temples who, in turn, command to the priests in charge of the lesser temples. In those territories where the Faith is mostly absent (such as Resdayn or the Yokedate), missionaries work in a single hierarchy lead by a single Patriarch.

Despite this remarkable unity of structure across time and space, there has historically been much theological variation within the Cult, from the Alessian Reforms to the War of Righteousness to the inclusion of Talos as the Ninth Divine. Most recently, the isolation of each Great Chapel during the Silver Plague lead to religious drift both in practice and beliefs. When the Council of Eight finally reconvened, it was evident that a new theological framework had to be created to allow the Eight Churches to co-exist. Thus were written the Paravanian Proclamations (also known as the New Alessian Covenant, the White-Gold Articles of Faith or the Great 4E 282 Compromise). The first of these serves as the creed that all new faithful must recite to enter the Cult. It reads:

>I believe in the One-in-Eight, Creator of Aetherius and Mundus, and swear to uphold His Order.

>I believe in Wisdom, the Insight that part lies, and swear to seek Understanding and Truth.

>I recognize the Shadow-of-Freedom, who lead Divinity into Sacrifice, and the Absent Architect, whose gift of Starlight is two-sided.

>I believe in Will, the Strength of the Soul and swear to Labor for the betterment of myself and my peers.

>I believe in Love, the Soul-Binding and swear to love my Other as myself.

>I give Praise to the Congregation of Saints whose Divinely-inspired lives are an example to all.

>I give Praise to Saint Alessia, who First Spoke Covenant in Dragonfire, and to her Companions who Guided and Enacted.

>I give Praise to Saint Martin who Fullfilled Covenant in Sacrifice, and to his Companion who Witnessed.

>I believe in Joy, the gift of Beauty and swear to cherish the life I am given.

>I believe in Righteousness, the Shield of the Meek and swear to Forgive the Lost and oppose the Wicked.

>I believe in Wonder, by whom the World is known and I swear to explore and respect the bounties of Nature.

>I believe in Balance, the Promise of the Wheel-of-Life-and-Death, and swear to honor my Ancestors.

>And I believe in Honor, the Law of the Dragon-of-Heaven-and-Earth, our Bulwark against Evil and Daedra, and swear to uphold Faith and Covenant.

Several heterodoxic or schismatic churches are known to use altered versions (most often concerning the placement of the praise to Saint Alessia) or add new verses. For example in the Temple of Khenrathi-Tava in Gottlesfront one can hear:

>I give Praise to the Winds that are what they are, that have ever guided and protected the Mortals.

In Bruma, the Great Temple of Ysmir's frontispiece bears the inscription:

>*Zu'u sahvot ko Dovah-ahrk-Joor. Ahrk vahriin grah zu'umaar.*

And in the Great Chapel of Auriel in Kvatch the faithful say:

>I believe in Honor, the Law of the Aetheric Dragon our Bulwark against Padomay's chaos and I give Praise to His attendants: Far-Seeing Magnus, Radiant Merid and Verdant Jephre. 

Despite this compromise, each Church maintains its own specific sets of beliefs. Here are quotes form various Primate expanding on the points in which their particular Church disagrees with the others:

**Anton Lockwise, Primate of the Order of Arkay, Cheydinhal, Second Potentate:**

>At Convention, Lorkhan lead the Divines into Sacrifice for the Mundus to be made, and from their deaths arose the first generations of mortals. So it is that our Ancestors are our link to Divinity, and by seeking their counsel through the veil of Death, we do not blaspheme but honor them. It is known that Arkay is the favored Son of Aka-Tosh, is the Light of Mundus, and is the Keeper of the Great Wheel of Life-and-Death since the Dawn. Why is it then that so many myths tell of the ascenscion of a mortal to the throne of Death? This is because we are our Ancestors sprung from their deaths. Those tales are but memories of mortals who rejoined the truth of their ancestry, shouldering the mantle of Birth and Death so that they may shepherd us who still dwell below. Thus it is that the Wheel turns: bringing souls back from the dreamful slumber of the Otherworld to the purposeful wakefulness of the Mundus. Thus do we need the counsel of the dead who know more than we and thus must we act to preserve the Balance upon which rests the Wheel.

**Marianne Ginis, Primate of the School of Julianos, Skingrad, Colovian Estates:**

>The fabric of the Aurbis is imprinted with the pattern of myth. This gives gods and spirits power but, their nature as mythic figures underpins their true worth: as archetypes and examples for us to understand ourselves. Thus excessive worship is redundant and potentially harmful, as it may lead one to care more about pomp and ceremony than the truths embedded in them. As such our reverence for Julianos expresses itself not through idle and rote prayers, but through learning and investigation, for that is what our Patron god teaches. Julianos offers but one true command, to seek wisdom, and thus his precepts are not theological in nature but epistemological. Where others may prescribe duties and taboos, shun certain practices, magics and beings, we do not, for we ask each faithful to construct their own wisdom, and therefore many of our own freely practice the so-called "black arts" of Daedra summoning and necromancy, with precaution of course.

**Maralie Balu, Primate of the Benevolence of Mara, Bravil, Second Potentate:**

>As Nir, Mara begat Creation, and we all of the Aurbis live in the warmth of that gift. Her Love flows from parent to child, from lover to beloved, from god to mortal. It was that Love that Shezarr sung to the assembly of Heaven, for them to beget the Mundus: a Heart for the Mother. Mara's boundless Love encircles us all, from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows, and calls for understanding and forgiveness, for *nen oeia ry metana,* "none is wicked by choice". Thus do we, Her faitful, welcome into our temples all who wish to enter, and so do we honor and know to be Saintly, all spirits, gods and heroes worshipped by the people of Dawn's Beauty. Remember always Mara's first teaching: "Love your Other as you love Yourself, for only thus shall You and I become We."

**Jo-Minal, Primate of the Resolution of Zenithar, Leyawiin, Ne Qui-Nal:**

>The world arose from the struggle of Sithis and Anuiel, and struggle has defined it ever since. The struggle of Mortal against Mortal, of Mortal against Himself, and Mortal against the World. And so Zenithar teaches us the most important of virtues: Will. It is by the strength of his character that a man may conquer his vices, it is by the strength of his arm that he may till the Land that Zenithar's blessed wife, Kynareth, gave unto him and it is with both that he may protect hismelf and his own from the depredations of evil men. But strength alone is not sufficient, for what use is a beast of burden without the farmhand to guide it? We know Zenithar to be the god who always win because he holds strength in one hand and cleverness in the other. Only by doing the same may you may you walk the path of heroes which is the best way to honor Him.

**Lalaine Denyan, Primate of the Temple of Kynareth, Sutch, Colovian Estates:**

>When the Divines sacrificed to make the world, it was Shezarr who gave the most, His very life and spark, and Kynareth mourned His passing. Her tears were the first rain and it was them who nourished the world so that the first trees grew. Kynareth cried until Akatosh showed Her the life that they had begotten and Her smile illuminated the Heavens, the first rainbow. Kynareth then made the beasts who feed on and, in turn, feed the plants of the Earth and She swore to protect and cherish those lives forevermore. She gathered the waters of the world into the great seas that surround Tamriel so that none who lived would be forgotten, and she filled the Middle Air with Her breath, which we call the Wind, so that we would always know that She is with us. But the world is a large place, too large for even a goddess to oversee by Herself and so She created Her sons, Morihaus and Mauloch and more, to rule over winds and beasts in Her name. All that we have, from the clothes on our back, to the tools in our hands, to the food on our plates, to the water in our cups, to the songs on our lips, we owe to Her generosity. And so we swear to revere and study Her creation and to go where Her winds carry us so that we may behold it better.

**Regulus Albios, Primate of the Temple Stendarr, Chorrol, Colovian Estates:**

>The world arose from the struggle of Sithis and Anuiel, and struggle has defined it ever since. All over the world, the meek, the weak and the unlucky are tormented by the harshness of the world and preyed upon by the wicked. Thus do Stendarr command us with His right hand to bring succor to the wounded, the diseased and the dispossed, just as he commands us with his Left hand to smite evil wherever it lurks. Thus are we both chirurgeons and soldiers. Yet, the greatest of all struggles is internal: Eight Virtues shepherd the faithful through the path of just life, but Sixteen Temptations lead into Eight Vices. Only the Divines know Perfection and so we forgive their faults to those who give into Folly, Weakness, Hatred, Despair, Cruelty, Dullness, Greed or Betrayal and bring them peace and healing, this we do even for heathens and heretics, for it is our god's command. But the Eight Vices beget the Four Abominations, who even Stendarr does not forgive: the shambling undead, flesh turned into prison, the parasitic vampire, greed and tyranny incarnate, the savage werebeast who denies his own humanity and their forefather: the fickle Daedra who refused Creation and now only trespass into our World to lead us astray.

**Farrokh Rajida, Primate of the House of Dibella, Anvil, Freehold Republic**

>The world arose from the mingling of Sithis and Anuiel. Some call it a struggle, but we know it to be love. The Aurbis is a place of love. Was it not love for us that drove the Divines into Sacrifice for our sake? Thus the best way to honor their deed is to love ourselves, and be grateful for the joy and beauty we were given. For the world *is* beautiful and it *is* joyful, as are all works of love. Be not ashamed of your passions, great and small, for Dibella teaches they are the Heartbeat of the World itself. We know the body to be the temple of our spirit and so we maintain it with pleasure and exercise, for which god would desire a dull or crumbling temple? Our dancing, feasting, merrymaking and lovemaking are how we thank the Divines. Our singing, Joy-spreading and art-making is how we imitate Them. Our Lady is not blind to the woes of the world, which is why She opens the gates of Her House to all and says "Come inside. Here you will find rest and welcome, here you will gather your strenghth to face the World anew."

**Hasphat Trieri, Primate of the Chantry of Akatosh, Cyrodiil City, Archdiocese of the Divine:**

>Time flows ever forward, unilinear and unparalleled, from this follows the unicity of the Principal Principle. That It manifests through the Anu-Pado bipolarity is but a false dichotomy which when examined reveals the necessity of Division by way of Archetypal Emanation: *Aad semblio impera, dela can carpio semblex.* The first level of which being, obviously, the Enantiomorphic violence of the Missing and the Absent, whose localized interferences expresses itself as the Eight Virtues and their exemplar Mantles. That each Virtue contains within itself the seeds of all others is naught but more unrequited proof of the Simian Truth a god may no more be worshipped alone than a severed limb live on. Yet in all the Divines, One stand as a perfect microcosm of Resolved Polarity: the Feathered Serpent of Static Potential, thus do we hold Him in greater esteem for His Motion is the Motion of Heaven and the Promise of ascendant return to the Original I that We all share, be it by Mantle or by Eightfold Covenant, the Star-marked road of Heaven shown to the Pelin-Al-Essia in Red Royalty. And so we say: AKHAT AE AURBEX AE ANU AE AI!

  
Finally, This theological fragmentation necessarily hampered the Great Chapels' attempts to assert their authority back onto the numerous foreign branches of the Faith, who, although still subordinate to them cling to the freedoms they enjoyed during the aftermath of the Silver Plague.

In Greater Wrothgar and Karth, the seven other high bishops act as mere advisors to the Patriarch of Akatosh who is so stalwart in his opposition to "neo-Alessian" theologies and has such a tight leash on the cult he is sometimes nicknamed "the Archbishop of Solitude". Conversely, In the ever-fractious Iliac, Patriarchs vie with each other for influence so aggressively that most Chapels relegate the shrines of the Divines they are not specifically dedicated to to a backroom (none dares yet to defy the Prophet Marukh's edict that "All Divine may be worshipped in every House where One is"). This sorry state of affairs has led the Masters of many Temples to act with little-to-no supervision to the point that some are fully schismatic. In the Commonwealth, patriarchs and matriarchs have suborned themselves to the high priests of the Nordic Gods, and so on.
