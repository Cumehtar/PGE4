*The [[Silver Companions]], a warrior group of the Commonwealth, are primarily based out of the [[Aalto]], where they maintain a mead hall and small fleet of longships on the White River.*

*This itinerant band of warriors claim descent from the Companions of Whiterun, an ancient and storied brotherhood, that appears to have nearly disbanded during the [[Silver Plague]]. Alongside the Silver Companions, the [[Dragon Monks]] and the [[Hunt of Jorrvaskr]] both claim descent from the Companions.*

*The Harbingers of the Silver Companions are chosen - or perhaps claim the title - from among the ranks of their fellows, as the first among equals. These Harbingers are often exemplary in some way - combat prowess, cunning, fleetness, marksmanship, drinking capability, silver-tongued, or all of the above. They often speak for the mead-hall, but do not dictate their actions.*

*A true list of the Harbingers would likely be impossible to assemble, at least from an outside perspective. Harbingers are often not announced to the outside world, and indeed there may be long stretches of time when the Silver Companions have no Harbinger at all. Instead, a rough list may be assembled from fragmented accounts, historical notes, and records of triumphs.*

**THE WANDERING YEARS**

*The formative years of the Silver Companions, beginning when the last of the original Companions left the city of Whiterun during the Silver Plague. The brotherhood appears to have dissolved to a large extent, merging with the wandering groups during those days.*

*-The Brothers: The earliest attested Harbingers, allegedly a pair of brothers who shared the title of Harbinger.*

*-The Duelist: Known to have been Harbinger at least a decade after the Brothers. Believed to have been a deserter from the Imperial Legions.*

*-The Thunderer: A berserker, who appears to have been able to use the Voice.*

*-[[Sylgja of Greymoor]]: Claimed to have been the best horsewoman ever seen in the Commonwealth.*

*-[[Trull the Spearman]]: First known Dunmer Harbinger, exceptionally skilled with a spear.*

*-[[Uhtred the Bold]]: Disinherited nobleman from the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar & Karth.*

*-[[Orgnar of the Axe]]: Last of the Wandering Harbingers, first Orsimer Harbinger. Wielded Wuuthrad against the Falmer at the Battle of the Shore. His impassioned speech the the Great Moot convinced the assembly to begin collapsing all entrances to the realms of the Falmer. Under his tenure, the Silver Companions were granted land in the Aalto, ending the Wandering Years with the construction of their new mead hall.*

**THE SETTLED YEARS**

*-[[Sigurd the Silver-Handed]]: First Harbinger to attempt to retake Jorrvaskr from the Hunt. Slain in battle.*

*-[[Agelmar Twice-Felled]]: Harbinger immediately after Sigurd. Rallied the Silver Companions after her death to prevent a rout. Began the tradition of secrecy of the identity of the Harbinger.*

*-[[Ignatius the Navigator]]: Led a fleet to the Niben.*

*-[[Gwynhyfar]]: Former priestess of Dibella.*
