After the Silver Plague had begun to recede, and Skyrim began to re-organize itself into the Commonwealth that we know today, its citizens began to rediscover a lost art: the Thu’um, powerful magic utilized by speaking the language of Dragons. 

Historically, this type of magic had been used almost exclusively by highly traditional Nords, but Snow-Throat had come to be comprised of a diverse mix of peoples and cultures, and the Thu’um was taught by both Dragons and Giants without partiality to any race.

This created tensions early on, with some Nords being protective of what they perceived as a vital part of their culture, especially following the resurgence of the Cult of Ysmir. Also contributing to this were certain groups of mer, who still held bitter grudges over the suspicious and sometimes hostile treatment of elves by many of Skyrim’s population before, during and after the then-recent Second Great War. 

While mundane usage of Words of Power quickly became so commonplace that most hostility among regular citizens dissolved relatively quickly, relations among the smaller groups who learned more advanced applications of the Thu’um under the tutelage of Dragons were much more strained. This resulted in schisms early on, many of which created separate groups with their own philosophies and tenets.

The old tales of Zuldenek and Zuldinok, two of the most famous figures from the early days of the Thu’um’s return, are believed to have arisen from these tensions and disagreements. These two Thu’um users were said to be mortal enemies, who fought a fierce battle of ideals using their legendary voices. 

Scholars debate as to whether these figures actually existed, or were merely representations of two major opposing schools of thought at the time. The two characters are venerated as saints by many of the disparate Ysmir cults, but both are rarely acknowledged by one group. There exist many opposing accounts of their battle, the circumstances and outcome differing with the views of the teller. 

Recorded here are the two most famous versions: one passed down among men, particularly Nords, and the other told by elves, primarily Dunmer. These tales provide fascinating insight into not just the differences in cultural use of the Thu’um, but the early days of Snow-Throat itself, when the land was even wilder than it is now, and new people and ideas fought for their place within it.


#**The Song of H’roar Hill-Throat and The Knife-Eater**

Long ago, when Snow-Throat still toiled in the untamed ruin of the False Dragon’s jealous blight, the returned sons of Aka began to again teach mortals to speak with the Storm Voice, as they had in times of old. 

Out of this time rose two Tongues: Hill-Throated H’roar, blessed Mead-Thane of Ysmir, who made wineskins of the scales of Sikhaalnaak; and Naga Knife-Eater, whose black mouth spewed forth profanities in Kyne’s sacred tongue. 

One day Ysmir spoke to H’roar, saying
 
**“H’roar, drink-husband,**

**Soil-sated skald, winefisted and merry.**

**Search this land for the dalk-tongued demon, Naga.**

**Sing unto him this Sovn-birthed song,**

**Of woe, and wicked storm.**

**For wrath which was wrought unto my worldly vassals,**

**With blasphemies breathed in mine own Voice.”**

And he told H’roar a sacred storm-song. And H’roar answered him “Aye, my lord Shor” (for he was drunk). And he set out to find the Knife-Eater. When at last he met his foe, the demon was teaching foul and wrong-mouthed Shouts to his followers upon a hillock. So H’roar drank from his wineskin, and sang the song which Ysmir had granted him:

*“Hi wo tinvaak vokul ko Kaan zul,*

*Bo nu ko daar hevno strunmah,*

*Kriist nid lingrah nau Shor gol.*

*Sosaal aan tiid ko vulom ahrk nah.”*

And the hillock was thrown on top of Naga, and he spoke blasphemies no more. But in his drunkenness, H’roar misspoke a single word, so once in a while the Knife-Eater slithers from beneath the mountain, and wears the skin of another to work mischief and deception upon Ysmir’s faithful. Watch for him, for his words are this:

*”Laas Los Mulhaan*

*Dinok Los Bo.*

*Dir Ko Suleyk*

*Uv Lahney Ko Sahlo.”*


#**The Legend of Vabria Nagavar and The Fool King of Hillocks**

Long ago, when Tamriel still bore glorious scars of Peryite’s testing Gift, Dragons began to teach all manner of mortals to speak their wrathful tongue, as they had done only for Men in times past. 

Out of this time came two wielders of Power-Throats: Nagavar, student of Mora the Lord of Knowledge, from whom he learned secret words that the Black Dragon had hidden away for himself; and Torevar the Fool King, a dirt-drunken bard who sang a never-ending Shout-song made of lies and praises to false lords and powers.

Nagavar traveled across many lands, teaching others the secret words, and showing them the true face of Ysmir-Who-Is-Missing, which is the Scribe of Black Books. He collected disciples, their mouths foaming with truths which they spake unto their brethren. When their number had grown, he led them to Snow-Throat to speak with Sikhaalnak, Mora’s servant who knew the first secret of mind-cutting. 

But when the Vabriavari arrived at the mound where the dragon resided, they found only his bones, his scales flayed for leather flasks of unsavory drink. But Nagavar was not deterred, and turned and began to speak to his followers, teaching them hidden wisdom with Xarxes’ own Breath. But from the South came Torevar the Fool King, with painted crown and drunken mouth, blowing away steads and killing wandering herdsmen with his slurred Shouting. 

And Nagavar told his followers “do not fear this drunken blasphemer, who seeks the missing Dragon and finds only a false King. He will breathe death unto me, but I will emerge again from the hall of the Scribe, clothed in dragon-aspect and spewing secrets from my maw for the Seekers to collect and record in the Black Volumes.”

And the Fool King devoured the mound, and vomited it upon Nagavar in the presence of his followers. Then he Shouted a belligerent storm-song, and half of their number perished in red rain. But the survivors went on to teach the secret truths they had learned that day, and slowly rebuilt their numbers. And Nagavar returns, again and again through the age, sharing the Dragon’s Truth with all who listen:

*”Laas Los Mulhaan*

*Dinok Los Bo.*

*Dir Ko Suleyk*

*Uv Lahney Ko Sahlo.”*
