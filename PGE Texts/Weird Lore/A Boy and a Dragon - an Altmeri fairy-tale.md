The story I am going to tell you is a lie. If I were to mark every fact and name that was forgotten or replaced, if I were to keep all the alternative and consequtive orders of events, then I would have to sing in exploding-fractal-mirror-sign-shadows-ET-MNEM. Let the others do that, I will simply lie to you.

Picture a child, sitting by the brook, waiting for his friends, his skin glowing softly golden. Twenty years ago his people came to this land, escaping from a great calamity of {worlds-colliding-burning-splintering-pieces-of-land-drifting-through-aether-skies-falling-down}.

He was born here, in the peaceful green land. I will lie to you again and say that it was called Feykro-se-wuth by the original inhabitants. You see, they were dragons - scaly, huge, old, wise, speaking with the voices of the elemental power. If you don't believe me, go find a dragon and ask it how their homeland was called, it will lie to you too.

In sixty more years, the boy would grow up, grow old, all the time doing the dragons' bidding in gratitude for the shelter, and die.

Scratch that.

Picture young boy with a golden skin, sitting peacefully at the riverbank, waiting for his friends - a red-haired one with the roaring laugher, and a broody big one. Suddenly the skies tear, and a great black dragon comes through. He is angry. He is not just angry, but specifically at the boy. Snap. The boy is no more.

No, that is not right either.

Picture young Xarxes sitting by the brook, waiting for his friends Shor and Trinimac to come. Their tribes have only recently come to this land, and the boys, the chiftains' sons of similar age, have struck an instant friendship. The boy looks at the brook, and the brook looks back at him. 'You will die', it whispers, 'the Old ones of this land do not wish you well, they will enslave you, make you the servants, use your hands to build the temples. You are short-lived, you and your children will whither and die, while they will stay immortal'. When his friends come, the boy tells him everything, but his friends betray him, and he is sacrificed to the black dragon god.

That's how it went. Or not.

Picture young Xarxes, sitting by the stream, talking to his new hidden friend, learning all twists and turns of the possible futures. He learns when to speak and when to keep silent, when to act and when to bid his time. In several years, he has gathered a secret following among the newcomers, they gather the supplies, and prepare to escape from their hosts-turned-overlords. When the time comes, they make their escape with the single most precious treasure - the word-breath of the dragon immortality.

They run across the icy wastelands, and their former friends chase them. On the broken ice, under the light of two moons, three childhood friends clash their weapons. The boy Xarxes is killed, ice and snow stained with his blood. His red-headed friend holds him in his hands and cries.

They run across the icy wastelands, he, and his big and brooding friend, their tribes stole away together, but the third one, of blond and red-haired bearded giants, chases them. They clash weapons on ice, and many of them die, the treasured word of immortality lost. Xarxes doesn't ever utter a word until his death, his eyes hollow.

They run across the icy wastelands, only few select survivors. His two former friends battle each other behind, but he runs away like a coward. His heart aches, but that is what his new secret friend had taught him - the knowledge has a heavy price. He runs away, he shares the dragon life breath among his followers, and they become ever so nearer to the immortality. But the shadow of the black dragon is ever behind, and he will come to reclaim his stolen treasure.

This is the lie I will tell you. If you want the truth, you will need to find your own secret friend and ask him - but beware of the knowledge gained.
