For the Anointed Eyes of Beseecher Dulak.

From Sarghag gro-Mashnag

First Gateweaver, *Impenitent Oath*.

Wrathful Beseecher, I invoke Malacath’s protection of the unworthy for disturbing your sorrow-silence, and recite the prayer of Rohi Zarga to blood-cleanse my faults. 

Several disturbing revelations have been made about the incident detailed in Report #3337. 

Firstly, it seems that Nargush may have been affiliated with the same rogue group of Orcs who have flown our banner during their raids of Nordic ruins in Snow-Throat for the past three months. This was determined by the detailed maps of Nordic burial sites found in his home, along with a letter which seems to be from a fellow member. 

Second, although inventory has been taken and he failed to make off with any mothsilk lattice, the aforementioned letter seems to suggest that Nargush had managed to create several detailed drawings of one of our ships, most likely *Kayra’s Anguish*, where he was assigned as an Apprentice Sinewmender. No such drawings were recovered during the search of his home. 

To this, I have included the contents of the letter, which was found hidden in a locked drawer:

*My brother in maiming and fellow sighted Witness,*

*The etchings of the lattices you provided are very enlightening. Knowing their function has given us a much greater understanding of the hollowed bone-frames detailed in your previous works. Varloran himself has seen them, and sends his thanks and blessing to you!*

*Every day I thank the spirits of our Sundered King for your continued safety. You should be cautious when sending even something so innocuous as letters; the guards at the southern gates have begun to question our story, and I fear they may grow suspicious of our visits, despite how infrequent they have been.*

*The searches have been going well, though the findings remain sparse. Many halls of stories have long since crumbled into dust. But Racuvar is very hopeful of this latest ruin (I cannot endeavor to spell its name), which we’ve been in for the last twelve days. Yesterday we found carvings that seem to depict the Sundered One in his Northern aspect, the first we’ve seen since our earliest searches.*

*Continue in penitence, my brother. Remember that the ones around you are blind, and it is no fault of their own. Do not think we endeavor against them, as enemies. No, when their Sight is restored, they will rejoin us as golden brothers and sisters.* 

*-Vashrielle, Repentant Sister-Witness*

The information detailed in this update has not been revealed to anyone but myself and Turach Shield-Law, who conducted the search of Nargush’s home. As such, none of the Chieftains have been informed; I thought that this decision was best left to your blessed discretion. 

Turach has instructed guards at all gates to check all incoming and outgoing parcels, no matter what they allegedly contain. All letters are to be scrutinized as well. I await the Council for further instructions on this matter. 

May your sorrow-silence bring clarity in your counsel with the Oath Father.
