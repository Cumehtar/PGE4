# BLOOD WANTED

_BLOOD IS THE ESSENCE OF LIFE!_  
_ALL ARE ANIMATED BY ITS SACRED CIRCULATION!_  
_GIVE THE GIFT OF LIFE ITSELF TODAY!_

For decades, the city of [[Skingrad]] has been at the forefront of a veritable panacea for all mortalkind!  The [[College of Whispers]] [[Institute of Ichorous Arts]] has developed a new body of medical care — Phlebotomy — the clinical practice of diagnosis, prevention, prognosis, study, and treatment of one’s blood for afflictions, disorders, and any other health maladies.  

Giving blood is a safe, simple, and speedy procedure with minuscule risk to the donor and unimaginable benefits for the recipient in need.  As little as one pint’s worth of gifted blood can be used to heal up to three patients!  And, in the same instance, an additional quantity of gifted vitality may be drawn for your own personal analysis at no cost. 

It is not human sacrifice, nor is it even blood magic by any common understanding of the practice.  Phlebotomy is a set of evidence-based technologies, arcane and mundane alike, and their curative efficacies have been proven time and time again, peer-reviewed in both clinical and laboratory settings.  

It is the transferential quality, specifically, which distinguishes Phlebotomy from the rest. The technician is a neutral third party between donor and recipient, who is specifically responsible for performance of the procedures to accredited specifications, all in concert with the informed consent of all participants as well as a professional ethical obligation to cleanse contagion with minimal harm.  

These principals are sacrosanct, enshrined in law, trust that its transgressions will always be swiftly retributed. 

All affiliated practitioners offer complimentary consultations to prospective inquirers and even personal analysis of any willing donations.  Accommodations and compensations are available for specially identified and screened donors.  

This announcement was published in partnership with the Elder Guilds of Hospitallers, Physicians, and Surgeons.  Made possible with generous contributions from our sponsors, principally the Janus & Rona Hassildor Foundation.

_YgM: Grim, innit?!  But it’s really true… we lost a great seaman once who gave it up to become a professional blood bag in Skingrad.  Not like this though, my guy had been dirty penpals with some lonely vampire lady for years before he finally decided to take her up on the offer to be, as he put it, “her blood baby.”  I can’t imagine it’s a terribly enriching line of work though, bleeding yourself dry for your daily bread, even if it comes served on the finest silver.  I see why people can’t shake the feeling of the “fox guarding the henhouse” feeling about all this…  Skingrad really just rationalized vampiric feedings into a whole way of life, didn’t they?  Worst of all, they very well may have the science on their side; even I know some salty old dogs who testified to its efficacy against gangrene, gout, and scurvy, can’t say I wouldn’t consider it myself if it came to it… there are worse vampire kingdoms to vacation in, right?  Obviously the Potentate and the Guilds think so too, “red flush” vacations in Skingrad have long been a fashionable, if guilty, pleasure of the elites…_
