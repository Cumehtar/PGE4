The nature of the soul has been a matter of debate among scholars and priests for millennia. However, recent research has brought us much closer to the truth of such matters, at least as the soul pertains to the old “white” and “black” divides. Indeed, many misconceptions must be rectified, and that is the purpose of this paper. First, however, some history needs to be established.

The original divide between white and black souls was devised by Vanus Galerion (2E 581) in order to combat the Order of the Black Worm by establishing legal “white” souls trapped from non-sapient beings and illegal “black” souls harvested from sapient beings. This has remained the “common knowledge” of souls even to this very day. It is, however, a purely political construct which bears little similarity to actually existing modern research. After all, Galerion’s old system of soul trapping defined the souls of Minotaurs as “white,” which would no doubt disturb our friends from [[Sancre Tor]]. 

In modern terminology the “color” of a soul is not a matter of size or humanity, but content. White souls are raw Anuic creatia, formless and easily shaped by the psychomancer. All souls are white at birth; research performed by scholars at the [[University of Kragenmoor]] (Rallon et al., 4E 355) found that the souls of feti are not significantly different in substance from the soul of an ox or a goat, often weaker. Black souls are dense with psychic substance: as mortal souls absorb mythic pollution in the form of memories, emotion, knowledge, belief, daedrons, magicka and so on, the density increases, the soul becoming “darker.” This process is a spectrum, however, not the crude binary dated literature might lead you to believe. The most common “black” souls in usage, those of condemned prisoners, are not as dense as the souls of great mages; size is also known to be variable, mammoths and very old trolls often have souls as large as an average Dunmer or Nibenean (Adair et al., 4E 260). 

In the past, necromancers erroneously believed black souls were inherently superior to white souls. Today enchanters and psychomancers have noted that both souls have drawbacks. White souls are generally useful for any kind of task, but are weak and therefore require a larger quantity for any given product. In contrast, black souls are much stronger but are specialized. Argonian souls, for example, produce more reliable water-breathing amulets and war veteran souls are more useful in combat-enhancing enchantments. Otherwise they are only about as powerful as a “grand” level white soul, sometimes weaker (see again, Adair et al., 4E 260).

Perhaps the most recent controversy in soul science has been the issue of “[[Souldust]],” the residual soul particulates which are emitted from [[Ingenium workshops]]. They seem to have negative effects on overexposure; the [[Benevolence of Mara]] in [[Bravil]] (4E 356) reporting incidents of patients gaining memories of other lives, imbalanced emotions, dissociated identities, increased agitation, disturbing dreams, insomnia, and mental fatigue. A similar report found this “soul sickness” is disrupting natural ecosystems, killing plants and causing abnormal behavior in animals (Elisgan and Cassa, 4E 341). Counter arguments from the Chorrol Academy and the University of Skywatch refute this, insisting such diseases are more complex and souldust is a negligible variable (Doran, 4E 347; Larethal, 4E 350). May future research endeavor to clarify these mysteries and unlock the true potential of the soul.
