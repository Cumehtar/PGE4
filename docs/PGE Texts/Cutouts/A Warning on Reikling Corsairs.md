*Seafarers in the Sea of Ghosts should exercise caution when encountering vessels adrift, especially near Solstheim. While some of these apparently abandoned ships may have fallen afoul of sea giant raiders, others are in truth a front for Reikling corsairs. The small, blue-skinned humanoids will position their ships near shipping lanes, whereupon they will conceal themselves amidst the barrels and cargo of their ships, waiting for their vessel to be brought alongside an unwary merchant. Once the ships have been tied together and boarded, the corsairs will then burst from their hiding places, brandishing spears and bows, and demand payment and loot. Upon receipt of their demands, they will cut away from the would-be rescuer and sail off, losing any pursuit among the squalls and icebergs.*

*Merchants are therefore advised to exercise caution, and have armed guards standing ready when investigating drifting ships, if they investigate at all.*
