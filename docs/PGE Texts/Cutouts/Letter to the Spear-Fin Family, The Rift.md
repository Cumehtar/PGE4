Ma, 
I know you warned us all that fishing on Lake Honrich would never prepare us for the rest of the world, but I had to go. I had to. [[Atmora]]! I know we’re generations removed, but that’s our homeland. Can’t let the mages go on their own to see what’s there. Besides, the pay promised for running the rigging on these ships was too good to pass up. Even the remaining winter fishing with all of the coming year won’t make the pay they are offering. Guess that’s why they were posting notices all over [[the RIft]].

There were carts waiting in [[Riften]], like the notice said. There was a caravan of us going up to the [[Windhelm]] docks. They even hired an escort for the 5 carts of crew and supplies that they were bringing up north. Oh, but that yellow land before we hit Windhelm. It’s like Pa after the spring willow festival with all those eggs. Guess you knew that, since you came down from [[Kynesgrove]], but you could’ve warned me!

At Windhelm, we met the captains. They picked the crew for their 3 vessels and went over their rules. We were told that they already laid in crates of citrus from Cropsford. We get a daily ration and we’re not to skip it. Figured they’d give us southern crew a good warning about these long voyages in the cold and dark. I peeked in one of those crates. Those are much bigger than the ones we’ve seen at market!

Captain Ice-Mane selected me for his crew on hearing the name in the roll. Said he knew of the Spear-Fins and wanted my kind in the rigging when the ice gets thick. Did you know him when you were up here? He seemed to know our kin well enough. Definitely knew uncle Murphy. 

We were barely north of Windhelm’s docks when a nasty gale brought in snow and ice off the seas. Captain Ice-Mane laughed at it and said Kyne was just toying with us before we reach the fun waters north of Winterhold, where the ice cutters sail. When the winds really got going, he thanked Kyne for getting us on our way. He wasn’t concerned at all, but the snow was thick and we could barely see the lanterns on the other ships.

Boatswain Delaney had me checking up on the backstays as he didn’t like the work done in Windhelm. Said they always cut corners there and he ain’ having it when we’re going into the dark. I didn’t see anything wrong with the work that was done, but I ain’t second-guessing on my first day.

Our watchers were calling out for floes. I could barely see them, but it was enough to cause us to correct a few times. When I was checking the stays and lines off the mizzen, you could see a few old wrecks along the way when the snow eased a bit. It would be just a few seconds. Kyne’s winds would pause, let us see a ghost of what came before, then bring in the snows again. Perhaps Jhunal wanted her to let us have a good warning on the way so that we’d stay vigilant.

Just as we made it to [[New Winterhold]], the storm broke entirely and only mild flurries saw us into port. You think the College up there had anything to do with it? Not so bad manning the yards into that port with only a light snow. It was beautiful! Kyne’s Lights were competing with the lighthouse to light our way into the docks. If it weren’t for the rocks and ships, the glisten of the ice and snow might make one snow blind during the day.

There’s a big inn here, where we’re to stay until the next wave of crew and researchers arrive. Stuhn’s Favored. You should see the whale on it! They must’ve gotten a giant to carve it. I tried to draw what we saw as we came in, but I don’t know if I did her right. One of the locals said it bodes well for us that they are having us stay at the inn and not on board our ship the whole time. Stuhn will keep us from meeting Old Mora, so long as we spend a night here, he said. They also have cross sweet rolls at the inn. As always, I’ll make sure to buy a few before we head out.

Don’t you fret none. I’ll be swapping to hide boots now that we’re up here. I can tell I can’t go barefoot for too much longer in this cold. We got a mix of Darkwater pine tar and Winterhold salts for our boots and gloves to keep us stable as we keep watch over the ship for ice buildup. I’ve worked with Darkwater tar before. We’ll be good and secure. I can hear you up here; complaining that I’ll be as dark as the ship’s cat and not fit for any matches you find. Well, if they can’t take the tar, they aren’t fit for me!

Boatswain Delaney said we have time enough to go up to [[Old Winterhold]] tomorrow, if we aren’t scared of the cold, and see her stonework. I might do that after my shift at preparing for icy waters. I would like to see it before we pass by the Skytemple Lighthouse. I’ll write again when we return from Atmora.

May Kyne keep the wind in your sails, 
Ulrica Spear-Fin
