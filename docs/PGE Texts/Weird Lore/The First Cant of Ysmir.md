*Ysmir strode into the plains and spoke to the wind.*

*"I have seen my face and slain myself. I am the king, the rebel, the hunter, the forgotten, the conqueror, the wanderer. I am of my fathers and my mother but I am separate. I stand alone."*

*"The wind replied, "My son, you speak of mirrors. Your father spoke of such things, & saw no end."*

*Ysmir replied "Mother, I am my own mirror. Can you not see? I have walked & walked & walked in many faces and names. My right hand holds a bloody sword and my left a plough, yet my right hand holds a plough and my left a bloody sword. I have spoken to myself and slain myself and hunted myself and worshipped myself and denied myself and cursed myself and blessed myself."*

*& the wind looked upon her son in sorrow. "My son, you must speak with your fathers, as your fathers did."*

*But Ysmir shook his head. "I have walked the cave and found it empty. My fathers are absent & the great fighting is not done. I think, mother, that I shall never see them again. I think, mother, that I will become a father, but not to myself."*

*& the wind was silent, for she had given all to her beloved son, yet she shed a tear of sorrow/joy to see him grown.*

*& Ysmir descended from the mountain.*
