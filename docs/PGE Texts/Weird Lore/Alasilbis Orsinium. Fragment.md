*A page which was allegedly torn from the* Alasilbis Orsinium, *a tome whose existence is dubious, but purportedly contains the beliefs of an obscure Orcish cult that has recently emerged in northern Snow-Throat. Currently under review for placement in the Fragment Collection of the Order of the Quill’s Library of Enlightened Texts.*

Brother and sister Ornim, once-noble people of strength and honor; why do you suffer your place in this world?

You, Ornim of Orsinium, children of hardship and strife; why do you walk eternally in the way of toil and broken oaths? Your bones crack, and you labor in vain for an uncaring god. Your children are travelers, unwelcome in foreign lands. The Beseechers choke in ash, beaten and bloodied, seeking the broken words of a fragment, a shadow of Royalty. Come, and See again.

The King Sundered once led our people in conquest. You have forgotten his name: TRINIMAC. 

He is dead. He is reborn. He is reincarnate. All three may be true. 

You are told that he leads us still, as Mauloch, the Bloody Curse. *Mauloch ne Ornim tarask voshucrun!* *Mauloch ae Adautaracu!* 

Behold, the Sundered One’s Name is threefold, and threefold are his Faces. To know all three is to know the Ruling King, and to serve him again as *Agra-Goltragga.* 

*As Mauloche Et Varlor, nu ede racuvarane heculnaga! As Varlorane bala, nu moraga gnithir! A ae alasilbis! A ae varlor aranracuvane!*

To unravel the Changing, the Outcast must first be bound. His
