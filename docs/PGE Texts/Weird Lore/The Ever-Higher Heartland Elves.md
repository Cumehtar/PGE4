**Description**:

&#x200B;

This operation was overseen by the Imperial Aurbical Survey,

progressing in line with orders from the late Emperor Martin Septim,

with approval from Potentate Ocato of Firsthold,

and in collaboration with the Royal Imperial Mananauts.

Following Edict 22.x3n.4E1S and the launch of the Imperial Sentinel of Hyperspacial Activities (ISHA), at 3:32 AM, the vessel experienced a sudden impact and failed to breach the atmosphere of Nirn. Despite launching on a clear night, the destruction of the vessel was not visible from below, and indeed, the ISHA appeared to have vanished in its entirety moments before we received a transmission. Only shortly after did large fragments of metal and stone begin to plummet from the sky, much of which appeared to be debris unrelated to the ISHA itself. Among the crew of fifteen survived only three, who were able to communicate via dreamsleeve transmission to explain their situation and their findings, following their surprise crash.

The ISHA had seemingly collided with a large land-mass, held in suspension approximately 50,000km above ground. The surviving crew had ejected from the point of impact and landed upon one of several other island-like landmasses in the surrounding areas. This floating mass is, or was, reported to be one of a total of nine. Eight islands - now reduced to seven, with the ISHA having crashed into and destroyed the stability of the eighth - were observed in arrangement around a ninth island in the center, with each of the islands surrounding it slowly spinning in an orbit around this central isle.

The most notable feature of these islands is not that they were floating, but that they were riddled with what appeared to well attended and undamaged Ayleid architecture. The immediate area upon which the Mananauts had landed showed numerous signs of active habitation, lights lit within buildings were observed, and several in-tact landmarks and statues could be seen. The most obvious of these was located directly at the heart of the central isle, a large and pointed Tower which extended equally above and below the island's surface, similar in appearance to a spike that had been driven through the land. Periodically, waves of various shimmering colors could be seen travelling the Tower's length, although the Mananauts were unable to precisely measure the period of time between these waves.

At 3:38 AM, a number of individuals, either with wings or winged apparatuses, were seen flying to and from the falling island after the ISHA's impact. Others came to investigate the landing points of the surviving Mananauts' aeropods. Contact with the Mananauts became scarce at 3:45 AM, until later at 4:16 AM, when another transmission was received from the Captain of the ISHA, Garland Rulician.

The following is a transcript of this dreamsleeve transmission.

>*Damn it all. Can you hear me down there? This will be Report #3. Maybe our last, given the circumstances.*  
>  
>*Officer Burdsson is fluent in Ayleidoon, and according to her, these people are speaking it. Or a variant of it, at least. What we've been able to understand would indicate that they view the ISHA incident as an attack of some sort, on account of the level of damage it dealt to that island. Unless they take a trip down below and investigate the fallen remnants of the thing, I'm not sure they'll realize that it isn't a weapon. They know that we're here, too, and they don't seem happy about it. Burdsson is sure she heard the word "kill" more than once.*  
>  
>*I'm still not quite sure how we hit anything in the first place. It's like this place just came out of nowhere. Too large to have been sitting in the night sky all this time, but I can't imagine it moving very quickly either, so . . . gods, where did it come from? And if it's always been here, how has it been kept hidden?  Nine hells, are there others out there like this?*  
>  
>*Hold on. I'm seeing something . . . some sort of . . . swarm of machines, fluttering out of the tower. The one in the center of the middle isle. They're like . . . fabricants, maybe, only . . . stoney. Some sort of blue light trapped inside. They're all flying out to the remnants of that island the ISHA hit. And . . . uh oh. Those ones look like they're coming towards us.*  
>  
>*What? Where? Oh, dammit, fine. I've got to put this on hold.*  
>  
>*Come on, keep left; heads down, careful. Careful! That patrol is about to--*

The transmission ended at this moment. As of yet, we've not received further communication from the Mananauts.

The significance of thriving Ayleid survivors, the strange developments in technology they display, the hidden nature of these folk and their lands, and the similarities in structure between these islands and the ancient arrangements of the Imperial City, are facts that hang heavily upon the heads of this council. The moth-minds do not have sufficient information on the matter to determine a course of action as of yet, which I believe is a misfortune we should make efforts to correct.

Although our resources are strained between the efforts to rebuild after Dagon's invasion and the efforts required to keep the peace without an Emperor, I would nonetheless maintain that we must make it a priority to discover what the Ayleid are up to in the skies, and to discern their intentions for the world below. Otherwise, we are leaving a blind-spot in the security of Tamriel; a blind-spot that appears to be angry with us.
