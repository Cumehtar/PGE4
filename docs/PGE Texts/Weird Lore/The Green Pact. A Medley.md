*The [[Green Pact]] is often misunderstood by outsiders. Even today, textbooks still use the framing of the “Divine Commandments” handed down from On High, perhaps a lens inherited from the old Alessian Order. This misses that for the Bosmer Y’ffre is the Singer, a Spirit of the Now. Even “Pact” might be a poor translation, one which feeds into imagery of cold, static laws. This is even more inaccurate as the Bosmer spread across Tamriel, finding themselves engaged with the push-and-pull of various cultures across Dawn’s Beauty. Perhaps a better analogy to explain the Bosmeri perspective on the Green is that of a traveling bard who sings a familiar tune, but improvises to meet the needs and dispositions of the current audience. May the passages which follow, taken from across the continent, serve to better elucidate the truth of diversity in the Green.*

***The Green Pact and the Ooze - A Traditional Tale***

*Before, was the Ooze. The world was chaotic void and the people without shape, an endless cacophony of meaningless noise. Eagles and Dragons and Scarabs fought each other until they became each other, Elves becoming Cats becoming Men becoming Elves again.*

*So Y’ffre called a Chorus, and gave every thing a Name and a place in the Song of the Green. The rustling of the Trees, the rushing of the Rivers, the warbling of the Birds; all have a special role in the Song according to their Name and purpose in the Natural Order. It is our goal, every one of us, to Sing in tune with the Green, with respect to its Order, lest we be cast out again into the Ooze.* 

***To Invoke the Name of God - The Jephrine Paladin's Canticle***

*The Singer did not give us the Pact to be a Tyrant over us; Jephre gave us the Pact so we may know the limits and test them. Is it not obvious? Nature abhors stagnation, but She rewards growth and ingenuity. We are asked to take part in Creation, in the Naming, in the Song of the Green, so others may marvel at what our ancestors have brought forth.* 

*Learn the Names; the true Names of the Trees, the Rivers, the Birds, the Stars, even the Gods themselves. Call the Names in Song, and they must come to your aid. Call them to shape cities, to heal the sick, to beautify the garden, to illuminate the ignorant, to reward the faithful. The Song is our ally, and no more faithful an ally will you find.*

***Graag-Unslaad - From An Evergreen Bosmer Saga***

*Alas, we were cast out of our homes! Scattered by the tyrants of the Old Dominion! And so we wandered. North we walked, as far as we could get from the cursed scars of our old woods. We at last found ourselves in a bitter place of cold winds, yet the Trees were Ever Green! Most assuredly, it was a blessing from the Singer. We grew new homes in this holy place, but some of the Northern Men grew wroth. There may have been blood, if not for the Voice.*

*One Sang and another Shouted, until the two were as One Voice. Mara moved Man's heart with compassion; was not Song also sacred to Dibella? Does not Kyne also have a fondness for Trees? Did not even Mighty Ysmir speak drem ov to the Spirits of Nature? And so we now use the Voice to better live in Peace with the Green, for the Green is Eternal.*

***Wyrd Words - A Daenian Bosmer Ode***

*...\[W\]e found ourselves in a new land, lost, forlorn,*

*But as we came upon the Great Tree we cried out,*

*For Silvenar, Elden Root, Archen Cormount,* 

*For every home-tree that we did still mourn,*

*And the wyrd-sisters heard our cry, and wanted to parlay,*

*For they loved the Singer, too, though in their own way,*

*They taught us of the Wyrd Tree, of the Rules of the Earth-Bones,*

*How to become permanent, rooted, nurtured forever,*

*Connected to the Roots of All, Green souls dissever,* 

*Other spirits, the ghosts and daimons, bound by the crones…*

***To Walk the Dawn Way - An Ayleid Retelling***

*Once we lived as perpetual children in a beautiful garden: the most Sacred Wood of all. Father Nature Sang to us our Names, and taught us to revere the Natural Order. But children must one day grow up, taking our Father’s teachings to heart as we find our own way. We cannot pray to the wooden Bones of the Earth forever, we must eventually look up to the Stars.* 

*Magnus reminds us, that Blessed Sun, that there is an entire world of Imagination beyond mortal reckoning we need only the mind to tap into. We Sing now not only in the Green, but also in tune to the Dawn. We forge cities of Light, and go higher, ever higher, until we forever escape the surly bonds of Darkness and reach the new home waiting in the Heavens.* 

***Forget What You Know - A [[Green Prophecy]]***

*To know the Green, put down your quill. Stop thinking, theorizing, or debating. It isn’t about Y’ffre, or the Ooze, for those are names and names are dead things. We live in the Spirit of the Now. Go outside and taste the water, smell the winds, touch the grass. That is the Green. The Green is the sweet aroma of fresh honey, the Green is the pile of dung that fertilizes new plants. The Green is a newborn fawn nuzzling its mother, the Green is a rotting carcass that feeds the vultures and insects. The Green is lived, it is the Song of Life, and it is the Song of Death.*

*Fixed laws and codes, cities of wealth and splendor, they get in the way. Corrupt the soul. So tear them down, I say. Forget every law of mine and thine, remember only the bloody law of the jungle. Live for Nature, for your tribe and your clan. That is how you begin to Sing with the Green.*
