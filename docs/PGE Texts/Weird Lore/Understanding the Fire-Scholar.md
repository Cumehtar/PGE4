“*Boethiah is the sacred flame, and Mehrunes Dagon is the fire of destruction. To know the difference takes the mind of the learned*.” - From the sayings of the Exalted Elders 

We are the scholars of fire. Our sacred task is to study magicka, the gift of Azura, and to control magic, the gift of Boethiah. Some call us tyrants. Others call us heroes. We are neither. We exist to fulfill our duty to the Ancestors, to Resdayn, and to the Hortator, in that order.

**Why were we formed?**

In the late years of the Septim Tyranny, magic was regulated by a foreign Mages Guild. They cared only for profit, not duty or piety. They did nothing to stop a host of foul necromancers and other dark sorcerers who ran wild across Tamriel, kidnapping youths, defiling tombs, consorting with Bad Daedra, and worse. Only after this madness came home to Cyrodiil during the Oblivion Crisis and the return of Mannimarco did the Imperials finally see the error of their ways. But it was too little, too late. Ald’Ruhn was destroyed by the perfidious wizards of the Mythic Dawn.

One survivor of that horror, who had known too well the wickedness of unchecked magisters, vowed to never allow it to happen again. When Resdayn was once more struck by the excesses of unregulated magic in 4E 48, the Grand Council finally heeded her call to form a new order. The Order of the Molag’kena.

**What is our task?**

We study magic so that we might control it. No avenue of study is forbidden to us. Our founder, the honorable Nartise Arobar, believed that it was necessary to understand evil if one is to triumph over it. We learn the ways of elemental war magicks, conjuration, necromancy, even the manipulations of souls. We do this so we may recognize the signs. Anyone who uses these magicks for personal gain has no place in our order. We also host great libraries, and perform extensive academic research.

By the grace of the Temple and the decree of the Hortator, we may arrest anyone in Resdayn practicing magic without licensure from a proper authority. In recognition of ancient rights, the Velothi Tribes are exempt from these laws. By right of treaty, most outlanders are also exempt. For information on licensure, see the nearest oathmer in your legal jurisdiction. 

We wield war magicks to fight necromancers, followers of the Bad Daedra, and generally any enemy of Resdayn. Perhaps this risks contamination; but fire must be fought with fire.

**How do I join?**

Perhaps you feel the call. So long as you are sincere and dedicated, you may join our ranks regardless of clan or tribe. Seek out a scout who may direct you to one of our outposts or strongholds on the frontier. Or travel to our headquarters at Silgrad Tower. You may prove yourself a worthy initiate to a recruiter. After extensive training, you will become a full-fledged member of the order only after passing the Rite of Flames and taking the vows. The greatest among our order will, after decades of distinguished service, become Exalted Elders: the leaders of the Molag’kena who formulate policy and directly advise the Hortator.

**What are the vows?**

The Vow of Piety:

*I shall serve the Ancestors in this life and the next. I shall do everything in my power to protect the holy places of the Ancestors from the defilement of necromancers and sorcerers. I shall never submit to the Bad Daedra.*

The Vow of Duty:

*I shall protect the liberty of Resdayn and its people from rogue wizards until my final breath. I shall accumulate knowledge of magic, and share it responsibly. I shall not abuse magic for self-gain.* 

The Vow of Gravity:

*I shall serve the Grand Council and the Hortator, advising them in the proper use of magic. I shall live soberly, avoiding strong drink and intoxicating smoke. I shall never disobey a commandment from the Hortator, unless it would break another vow.*

Walk with virtue.
