*"Selvane,*  
*What in the name of Dagon's balls are you guys doing over there in Cheydinhal? We've been waiting for the Synod maintenance workers for over three weeks, and now I here they won't come because they haven't been payed yet? I'd like to remind you that while you get to sit over there and have brandy with the bigwigs, we are stuck over here in this maze with a bunch of invading daedra and a layer of dust so thick a slight sniffle will give you tunnel cough. Just the other day I saw poor Alberic's skin melt off his face while trying to get rid of a watcher, which I would like to remind you:* WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IF THE LIMINAL WARDS WERE PROPERLY MAINTAINED! *How does Helseth expect us to try to find any more of the old Reman-era mananaut files down here if we constantly have to worry about a tentacle being shoved up our ears and stealing all our knowledge? If we get yelled at for failing this task, I* WILL *tell them it is your fault.*

*Your Old Friend,*  
*Cassia*

*P.S. Bring some brandy down with you next time you visit, will you? We had to bar the door in Mundic space over security concerns with locals of Cyrodiil City and the portal can't be open all the time; we've had to make a makeshift barracks in the old Septim-era land deed room."*

*"Dear Cassia,*  
*It pains me to say you may have to hold out a few more days, the Council had a few..... accounting errors with the recent annual budget that just went through and are still trying to figure out how to move things around to get everything done, but rest assured, I will do everything in my power to ensure the workers get there as quickly as possible. It is also unfortunate to hear of Alberic's passing (I do assume he passed? I would not imagine a person can live without a face). Have you tried bargaining with the Watchers? While no doubt Mora sent them to try to get access to the same older Memosporic Storage Lattices that you yourself are looking for, or of similar importance, you may be able to fend them off for a bit by trading relatively useless information. I mean, there's what like, three thousand years worth of genealogical trees and budget reports? Just give them some of the First Empire ones in slave cant that no one can read anyways, I'm sure they'll buzz right off for a bit at least.*

*Also yes, I will deliver you guy's some brandy on my next trip, I have to deliver some spine polish to Eats-Old-Books anyways. I'll throw in some Black Horse Courier newspapers and some Shenanigans' decks while I'm at it, wouldn't want you to get too bored in your free time (See, aren't I nice?)*

*Yours,*  
*Selvane"*
