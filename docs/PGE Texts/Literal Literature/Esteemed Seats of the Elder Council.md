“Ashes have little care for the destruction they postlude.”

There was a hush amongst the [[Elder Council]]. It spread lazily, from one head to another, like a heavy fragrance. It took Tivêra a moment to understand, a junior councilor as she was.

Qúint Qúaest, who had spoken, was a member of the Eastern Compatriots’ Assembly. Behind his faction’s arc of the assembly table was a large portrait of [[Longinus Libro]], the first potentate. It was because of this affiliation that his opening line revealed a double meaning. By ashes he had meant an ashen skin tone, (or so Tivêra deduced) and by that identifier he could have only mean the Wolf-Guar himself: [[Hlaalu Helseth]].

The Old Potentate watched carefully. The bags under his eyes had become so dark they were like carved grooves. He sat at the opposite end of the table from Qúint, flanked by members of the Commerce Group (the Hlaalu sect specifically).

Small forks of lightning rippled through the starry sky that hung between them. The table below rippled like water.

“To wage war is to engage in struggle,” Qúint continued. “To believe that war is struggle against our enemy alone is naive, and at times even foolish.” He spoke in a grave way, his long beard wobbling with each word, like a stalactite of foam. “Can any amongst this honourable gathering list the four principal rights of Longinus Libro Thought?”

“The right to peace,” Helseth replied, his voice a growling warble, aged and throaty. A jellyfish Daedra gently bobbed up through the air next to him, its feelers briefly tangling around the arm that supported his head.

“Peace! Peace—how can this Council abide by the Regent Congresses if it fails to uphold peace?”

Helseth hoisted the corner of his lip into his cheek, revealing a long tooth. “War is not the anathema of peace.” There was whispering as he gestured to the portrait of Longinus Libro. “I made his acquaintance in 221; do you know that date?”

There were scowls amongst the Eastern Compatriots’ Assembly. Their frustration caused knots of pale fires to ignite in the air. Amongst the factions there were none more dedicated to Longinus Libro Thought than they, though few standing councillors could claim—like Helseth—to have been one of his confidantes.

Eventually, one of the Guild Masters' Society spoke up: “The Southern Undertaking.”

Tivêra took a moment to understand why. Within the Council, there was no such thing as an honest act. The guild master, she realised, was that of the Cooks Guild. Tivêra had been personally involved in the recent audit of [[Cropsford]] by Census and Excise, and in particular had investigated the buy-up of land by a limited liability company. That company’s shareholders included many associates of the Cooks Guild itself. Tivêra decided to herself that the organisation was aiming to curry favour with Helseth. Why? The powers of the potentate were ultimately limited by the Elder Council’s opposition factions: the Eastern Compatriots’ Assembly, the Cyrodiil Society, the Bruma Committee et al. This made it almost impossible for him to levy many policies.

Except, of course, in times of war. One of the articles of the Second Regent Congress allowed the potentate to levy taxes, duties, and tariffs during wartime. If the Leyawiin Commitee’s lobbying for war did succeed then Helseth could implement protectionist trade policies to eliminate competition for agricultural goods in Nibenay, driving up profits.

Tivêra hummed. Maybe the Hlaalu were in on it too. The increased output in Cropsford meant increased economic throughput: more labour, more seeds, and—most importantly—more ash fertiliser, one of the Hlaalu’s big exports. Politics and economics, Tivêra decided, were studies in the movements of atoms: the analyses of cause, effect, and dependent origination.

“Longinus Libro’s second principle right is that to good government,” Helseth continued, “and good government must select the correct policy for the correct situation. For as long as Leyawiin is outside our control we cannot guarantee the movement of goods through the Niben, and for as long as our economy and security are outside of our control we cannot say there exists the state of ‘peace’, merely a condominium of anxiety and inevitable ruin. When me and Longinus embarked on the Southern Undertaking, we drew swords in the name of peace. The dislodging of the Bravil Clique was the victory of a peace in long terms, not short. Reclaiming [[Leyawiin]] shall be in a peace in terms that has no due date.”

“Kill meee,” a councillor whispered, just next to Tivêra. Like her, he was unassociated with any faction, probably a recent hereditary ascendant to the Council.

She summoned a folded paper note into her palm, an ease of lucid dreaming, then pushed it into his thigh. He startled a little, but gingerly received it into his hands. All the estimations had been made; this was merely the correct cause for the desired effect, one atom bumping into another.

Tivêra returned her attention to the council. At some point the sky had become a flock of Daedra shaped like whales, their bellies a great white sea hung facewise to the ground.

“Bah!” Qúint replied. “We have sieged Leyawiin more times than the tide has come in! What will make this particular bloodbath different?”

“We shall have the Argonians.”

There was disquiet within the hallowed assembly. Argonian warriors enjoyed great fame in the Potentate due to their exploits in the nation’s state-building. Without Orpedes Skote, there wouldn’t have been a Potentate at all, and everyone knew marsh experts like him would be needed in a battle for the Trans-Niben.

“A band of mercenaries won’t provide what the [[New Model Legions]] already does.”

Tivêra sank into her seat. The NML was by far the greatest fighting force in Tamriel, but the officer corps was staffed in a near perfect 1:1 of actual military men to civilian advisors. The civilian half was commissioned to ensure all military actions complied with the wishes of the Elder Council, and often with Longinus Libro-Helseth Thought specifically.

That made the NML clumsy and naive. At times embarrassing.

“No mercenaries. I have secured an alliance with Argonia itself.”

“They would never with a Moriche.”

“But they would with a Niben.”

Qúint bit his lips. The ECA had a strict and legalistic approach to the articles of the Regent Congresses. One particular article of the Fourth Regent Congress stipulated that any citizen of the Potentate was a Niben. It was impossible for Qúint to argue now without appearing hypocritical.

“Compatriots!” he began. A change in tactics? “The funeral bell of empires is the rattling of sabres, and it is the death of our children, the sharpening of our ploughs, the erosion of our virtue!” An appeal to emotion? So soon? Tivêra looked to the mass of viridian tentacles that hovered behind the council speaker and her elevated seat. It held a clock in its grasp, which approached the hour. The ECA had opted to speak last for the sake of impact, but that had left them too little time. More and they might have bested Helseth in law and constitutionalism.

“But for us there is a war beyond war: A destiny above destiny. It is the opening of the sky; it is the stretch of the earth. It is our homeland under heaven, one made to engulf the other. It is here the dark shines like day; it is here the night has long begun. Still, my comrades, in the east there sleeps the wide disc of the sun.” Qúint coughed in his old age. “And remember, the fragrant one lacks judgement still.”

(A pithy proverb, Tivêra thought; Helseth did have a penchant for Telvanni bugmusk.)

“The votes will now begin,” announced the council speaker. Tivêra’s eyes flicked to the Commerce Group. Some nodded back, then she reached over to the bored councillor next to her and squeezed his hand. The tentacle Daedra moved above, reaching out its tentacles, attaching a toothy sucker to the front of everyone’s forehead.

There were a few slimy moments as it extracted the vote from everyone’s head, then a deep voice: “Hmm, yes, I seeeeee,” it echoed. “My! There are 36 nays to 35 ayes, and 10 absent; the nays will have it!”

“The nays have it!” the speaker repeated. “There will be no war in the Trans-Niben.”

Tivêra sighed in relief.

The various ceremonies of a finished session began. At their end, the dream was extinguished. Tivêra awoke with a start, coughing up mucus and some fluid that must have come from her lungs. She reached for the iced tea sat on the night table, silk sheets falling down her body. She took a few sips. It tasted like apricots. Just across her room, the curtains softly blew, and beyond them the city of [[Bravil]] bristled with life. Tivêra shakily stood and wobbled over.

Curving streets, rock ponds, lacquered surfaces: Bravil was a city increasingly built on visions of beauty that were asymmetrical, naturalist and sought after a certain type of ‘just so’ exuberance. Balconies scaled up over the water in a precarious stacking of homes, building up to sloped rooves. Skiffs sailed up against frigates and junks as they slid into the docks. It was there that the Nibenese All-Union of Guilds were organising from inside a pagoda.

Tivera narrowed her eyes. Were they agitating for strike action?

Other countries were lucky enough to not really have guilds: Their artisan groups were being slowly outproduced by Iliac modes of production that didn’t rely on artisanal knowledge and expertise, except—of course—in the Potentate. Here, they had invested their guild dues as capital to purchase the new means of production, reaping profits according to those dues. Despite that privilege, they continued to abuse their effect over the economy to bully the EEC and other groups into providing preferential treatment.

Tivêra scoffed. She made a note to have the house guards show them her own form of strike action. As well, she reminded herself to find the name of the councillor she had bribed, including arranging a transfer of EEC stock to him. Its value would have plummeted if the Potentate had gone to war with Leyawiin, since the Company enjoyed exclusive extraterritoriality through the Trans-Niben, as well as a treaty district in the city. War could risk these economic privileges, and victory could mean they were no longer exclusive. Although it had been essential that the mobilisation decree failed in the Elder Council, it was also essential that EEC representatives in the Commerce Group were not seen publicly voting against it. That’s why nominal independents like her were important; otherwise the EEC risked its place in Helseth’s Camarilla.

In the distance, dragon banners flew through the air like streaks of blood, casting shadows under the light of the breaking dawn. Across them were the inerrant words of the Potentate, written in bright gold:

_LONGINUS IS YOUNG AGAIN_

_THERE IS NO WARRIOR BUT ORPEDES_

_NIBENAY STANDS ALONE HEROICALLY IN THE UNIVERSE_
