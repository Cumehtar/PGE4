Stithulf could count the cities he’d been to on one hand. Riften, several times. First as a boy with his friends, stealing away on riverboats to cross Lake Honrich and trawl the canals and docks, then as a militiaman, sailing in on those same riverboats, above deck this time. Ivarstead, to wonder at the amphitheater of the Great Moot and the barely-visible monasteries upon the holy slopes of the Throat. Eastmarch, city of skalds, city of cold stone and warm candles, passing through the docks again and again, to and from the north coast in the Years of White Summers. And now Winterhold.

Winterhold. No city like it, the sailors said. No port like it, the sailors said. No, not even Dawnstar, nor Solitude, nor any of the Wrothgarian cities to the west, was like this city. Nor the Resdayni cities of the east, though the Ahhemusa of Sheogorad might have some similar. No, the sailors said, Winterhold was a singular city.

It was a damned cold city, is what it was, Stithulf thought.

The roadway he stood by switched back and forth as it climbed from the Port of New Winterhold to the College of Old Winterhold, granting him a view of the port and the sea beyond. The sea was grey and white, the color of dark slate, pocked by squalls of rain and floating ice. Far off, the sky and sea met, grey meeting grey.

Somewhere off in that grey lay Atmora, land of the midnight sun, land of frozen bearded kings. Or not, from the reports he’d read and stories the expeditionaries told. A land of tundra and glaciers, ruins of Atmora of old slumbering beneath snow and ice. _Atmora_.

Magnar called to him from Atmora, and he answered. A land to search out, to wander, to dig in and scout out.

The sound of a bell ringing brought his attention back to the Port. Below, a ship was making its way to the docks, oars sweeping through the water. An assortment of dockmen had gathered, making ready to throw out ropes to bring the ship in and tie her to the dock, joining the dozens-odd ships already moored inside the seawall. In the ship’s wake a sea-chariot raced, harnessed horkers drawing the small craft to a beach to the east of the docks. Two women stood in the chariot, bleached white hair whipping in the wind. Fryse hags, most likely, in from one of the watchtowers along the coast. The chariot passed the ship, and Stithulf could make out shouted greetings from both the crew and dockhands. Mutual respect. Earned, not demanded.

_Nid thur nunon zul._ No lordship but voice.

Stithulf’s eyes wandered the port itself. No city like it indeed. The buildings of the Port were long and low, resembling ship’s hulls overturned. From what he understood, the earliest buildings had been overturned ships, beached on the shore during the Plague. The design had stuck, and been improved on. Rounded roofs, blunted or flat ends, thick stone walls, wooden slat floors with pits beneath to let cold air collect in - dim interiors, to be sure, but _warm_, even in the chill of the Sea. From this high on the path, all the buildings looked small, but he had walked the plank streets himself. The largest could fit a giant comfortably, to say nothing of the warehouses and drydocks that could swallow ships easily.

The Port of New Winterhold. No city like it, indeed.

A gust of wind whipped at Stithulf, bringing the promise of cold late spring rain. Stithulf shivered in the damp cold, turning from the view back to the road. Balls of magelight were beginning to spring up from the cairns that marked the path, streamers of fabric whipping in the wind, obscuring the dovahzul inked upon them. Ahead, the glow of the College beckoned, lights of taverns and houses blending with the cold light of magic. A lecture on alchemy in one of the college halls, some time perusing books in the library, then a cold walk back to the Port to find the prospecting crew in Stuhn’s Favored Inn. The next day they would ship out to Atmora, to find whatever awaited them there.

But for today and tonight, he had Winterhold.

Winterhold, city of magic, city of ice.

Of the cities Stithulf had been to, and would ever be to, Winterhold would forever hold a special place in his memory and his heart.

*Winterhold.*
