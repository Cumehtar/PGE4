 It is, perhaps, surprising that so many studies have continued to dive into the old, musty, and often dangerous ruins that dot our landscape. In the centuries that have passed, we have found new ways to access what has been left behind. The ruins that have flooded are among the best for the practice of Eiditic Hydrogeomantic Illusionary Chrono-Alterations. While they are rather expensive to fund research into, as the mercenary adventurer class of knights has several surcharges around injury, dismemberment, and drowning, we learn more from watching these proceedings than scouring any library. The methods came to us via Ciphers in Apocrypha, yet there had been no adverse effects noted from the use of the techniques, aside from the aforementioned drowning.
 
The last team that we sent into the field found that a passage had been opened in Norvulk Ruins. The stones of a wall had been dislodged by a sinkhole revealing that there had been more than one level to this ruin. While there was the loss of 2 mercenaries and a researcher to the movement of debris and a second researcher to drowning from the spring that opened into the ruin, their lives were not given without the advancement of knowledge from this uncovered location. The remaining members of the team had been able to secure several smaller artifacts back to Wayrest after running initial EHICA scans. From the artifacts and subsequent investigations, it is requested and urgent that we conduct more dream-shielding studies in nearby Wind Keep.

Further Investigations: From previous studies and tomes from ages past, we have known Vaermina cults to have been active in Stormhaven. Some smaller cults have sought only small scale power or revenge. Larger cults have had a remake of Nirn via Quagmire in their itinerary. Decayed inventory lists from previous eras include potions to disrupt sleep patterns so that dreams do not occur at all, provided by an Azura following. 

Note: Studies from the Alchemical Branch on a non-Daedric variant have indicated that long-term usage is not recommended, but not always avoidable. The Wayrest Library of Arcane Studies contains observations of those effects on those housed within the Daedric Influences Isolation Ward. Visual hallucinations of butterflies or star patterns and auditory whispers reported. (See Advisory on Dream-Blockage Compounded Elixir for further details.) 

The initial EHICA scans within Norvulk showed more extensive offerings to Vaermina and gave a suggestion for where statuary may have been present. Secondary scans were conducted a week later by the containment team, which suggested that deeper scans to determine the nature of the rituals was necessary. I attended this ruin with the tertiary team, after the ruin was deemed secured and contained. The waters from the spring that ran into this lower level of the ruin were cool and clear on entry. There was the slightest hint of lavender and chamomile in the air, unlike the dusty stale air in the upper floor, with its perfume of mildew. As the sailors might note - the calm before the storm.

I set up the braziers and stones used for the extensive EHICA studies. With the use of both welkynd and culanda stones, the shades that appeared had a pale sea green color. The Ciphers have assured me that we are not causing a rift with Apocrypha, despite the color tone that is often present. As a precaution, I had other researchers monitoring the site for any new activity or breeches. A precaution that was valuable to this study. 

We were witness to the shades conducting their own rituals. As they were not distinct enough, we could not be certain of the races of the beings brought in to the chamber. Humanoid slaves, to be certain, based on the method that they were escorted into the chamber and the screams that followed. Height for those escorted in was on par with average Breton subjects. No tails were noted. 

It is not often that the visions given by EHICA procedures include sensory information beyond visual. (Confirmation from the Ciphers on the nature of these occurrences pending.) In this case, the auditory components were clearer than the visuals. The screams came often. The range of tones indicated that there was no specific exclusion to a singular gender or age group. Despite the accenting of the words being unusual to our ears, we could make out calls for mercy. Those calls went unanswered. In the breaks from the screams, there were wails and sobbing.

The other researchers present also confirmed that the scent in the room changed. The undertone of lavender was overrun with the smells of wood smoke and something akin to licorice. Possibly a method to calm those that were brought in, despite the screams. It is unclear if it worked on those we witnessed. After study surveys yielded that it did not calm any of the team present. 

The vision shifted at this point. We watched as an overlay of the ruin moved on to the next chamber. The screams were louder, though the vision was still very hazy and indistinct. From what we could see, it appeared to be rows of cages in the room. Mats or hay beds, perhaps, were within those cages. No torture implements were noted. The vision entered one of those cages. A meal of some variety was provided; again the vision was not clear enough to make out the details. 

When the vision did start to resolve into something clear, we were no longer viewing the inside of Norvulk. We watched as towers grew impossibly high, catch fire, topple, and then take on new shapes. The screams shifted into a chorus. Not a joyous one, such as occurs at the Temple to the Divines. 

“Mara preserve us,” I heard one of our guard mutter, “that stench is worse than the Wayrest Sewers in Sun’s Height.” One of the researchers must have agreed, based on the sounds he was making at the far corner of the room. I will not attempt to describe the scent we were assaulted with, but it was quite unpleasant.

Colors started to encroach on the pale green. First darker greens and purples, then blackish shadows. As more towers grew, there were lights in the openings. Some fires were reddish, while others pale blue. The towers began to shift in style as Ayleid architecture gave way to Altmer and then to castles erected in Daggerfall and Wayrest. Explosions rocked both castles, which tumbled into masses of stone, before the stones shifted to create what appeared to be the Great Arch on which Solitude is built. A great fire ravaged across the top of the Arch before the scene changed again. The fires grew and, in the now red landscape, giant trees loomed overhead and threatened to drop fiery branches everywhere. 

The researchers at the far end of the chamber called out that their secondary scans were beginning to pick up activity. This EHICA deep-scan procedure was thus ended and the braziers were dampened. Even as we removed the various stones from their holders, our guards noted that the shadows still appeared to have movement of their own. 

The vision was surely Quagmire. In accessing the eras old memory, we had drawn the attention of those in the present, for the veil was easily pierced to that realm. We have put up several barriers and warning sigils on the ruin. Additional teams have been dispatched to monitor the area, including Wind Keep, for nightmare incursions. Alchemical teams have been tasked with producing elixirs similar to what we have in the archives for dream-state reduction. Residents of Wind Keep will be offered them at a subsidized rate from the Wayrest Mages House for a time, until we are sure that the threat has been properly contained.

Current Threat Assessment: High risk of Incursion from Quagmire. Heightened risk of Vaermina cult activity. Moderate risk of Sanguine cult activity, as nightmares increase tavern activity. Low risk of other Daedric activity. 
Recommendations: 
Monitor Menevia area, including Wind Keep, for problems with sleep and nightmares. Monitor taverns in the same locations for excessive drinking. 
Level 4 containment shielding on Norvulk Ruin to deter treasure hunters, bandits, and cult activity. 
Prepare isolation ward for an increase in population. 
Increase production of dream inhibiting potions.
