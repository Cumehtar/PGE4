**\[This is based on the story of an actual TES tabletop one-shot I ran, which in the PGE4 group chat we thought would be a good idea to appropriate into an Folk Legend & Story. Good luck figuring out what the hell even happened in the game.\]**  
  
'Who walks there, dreary in the night?', said the noble blood-sucker. 'Who walks there, seeking their life!', said the gold-skinned Altmer. 'We!', was the shout.   
  
Around the round table they sit, so empty yet quiet. The Mer and the Vampire, not sure who's the pilot. The Party of Seven approaches, their mission awaits. Their minds are so damaged, they cannot weight the weights.  
'Ye heroes! Your memories may be lost, however, render unto the reward we so seek. For if our quarry grasps it before me, collective ruin I foresee!'.   
However, the elf shouts 'but deliver it not to the Vampire, for his worship of the Sower of Strife foreshadows a greater will of domination towards thine poor race'.  
And yet the Vampire shouts also, 'deliver it unto me, brave armigers, for the Elf is the enemy of our realm, who spits naught but lies, the seed of division and doubt!'.   
And they say 'But oh, ye aimless walkers, let us give you aim and arm. Take our coin, shop and cram. Equip yourselves for servitude!' 

The Party of Seven departs. They rack their brains, yet no memories can be found. Stories of grandeur, adventures of old, they are lost! To the pit of passions long gone, they are whisked away. But who has taken their life? Who made them shells of their person? For if one lacks their memory of their own person, is one the same person?  
  
The thought gnaws at them at the ancient ruin of the last of the Elves become Undead. Follies they commit on the road, innocents they savage, their brains ravaged, given aimless aim and aimless arms.   
At the ruin they collect, the prized reward they get. To the tower of Kings they head, by which their insanity is beset.   
'It is your prize we carry!', shout the Party of Seven, 'Now let us out, for in this endless dream we tarry'.   
'But who of us shall have the trophy?' say the Councilors, 'Who of us has taken your memory?'   
'One of you, it was!', shout the Party of Seven, 'We tire of this! You are both bold and craven!'  
'We detest your politics, your rigidity and lies. You use us dry, in blazing fires you will die!' 

As the dust clears the room, countless corpses lay near. 'What have we done?', says one of the Seven, 'We have tore them apart, with an attitude most brazen!'   
'We declare ourselves Emperors, our crown is that of fire. In our tower we fight, a siege will bring us delight!'  
And so it was, for twenty an hour and three on the minute. The Legionnaires came, they seized these mad traitors! 'Who are you, so mad yet unknown, to massacre your betters?' 'We are the beaten and restless, we are tired of oppressors'   
On the gallows they say 'We regret nothing, and so we will die!'. Their madness has taken them, no fault of their own- for their fate was weaved by those greater than their own. 

And so it for the rest of the days- the chairs were replaced, their seats stuffed with hays. The people kept walking, their heads kneeling down, in the memory of the Seven, who fought 'til the dawn.  
For a day in the year, Seven Emperors had reigned. Their Empire was ruin, destruction and pain. They taught us a lesson, most valuable, I think, about the days of the week, and their meanings that we must keep.

Sundas, our Sun, it's dawn bringing hope.  
Morndas, our Grief, for those who are gone.   
Middas, our Mediocrity, when we hurt and we break.  
Turdas, our Life, which is shit, I must spy!  
Fredas, our Freedom, so good it has come!  
Loredas, our Knowledge, the dangers we love.

For all of these days have one thing in common - they're the breed of the deeply scarred and the hollow. The cries of the women, the ringing of the bells. The storming of the towers, the rains that are ahead. If evil we grow, it's crops we will sow, those broken and shaped by our sin and our gallows. Tender them, we must, lest they be at our throats - heed this, my betters, 'fore they crowd by your doors.
