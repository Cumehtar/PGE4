*This is a background story for an ongoing rp on the PGE4 discord.*

Moragada sat atop a rock, surveying the mess. The steam-chariot lay overturned in the ditch, its Dwemer brass glistening in the orange sunset. The two Redoran guardsmen who had been riding on either side were charred beyond recognition, their bonemold armor making them look like the skeletons of some gruesome, unknown creatures. In front of the wreck was the automaton - what was left of it anyway - still spitting steam from its melted body. Even in its mangled state, Mor was able to note with some satisfaction that it had failed to fire off a single bolt from its arm-mounted bow. He looked at the assassin lying in the ash, with three bolts embedded in their chest from Stithulf’s crossbow, and smirked to himself.

Stithulf walked around the scene, checking the dead and collecting what he could from them. He pulled the three bolts from the assassin’s chest, and then both of them - the fair-featured Orc adorned in golden paint and lamellar orichalc, and the tall, red-bearded Nord in the leather brigandine - looked at their client. Their very dead client.

“Couldn’t have gone better.” Said Moragada, his face showing no humor.
“I could have killed more of them.” Replied Stithulf. He actually sounded sad about it. Moragada climbed down off of the rock, wincing as he used his left hand to steady himself; his left shoulder blade had a small piece of brass embedded in it.

“*Both* of them.”

He looked at Stithulf.

“There were only two of them.”

Stithulf looked back at him, frowning.

“There were only two…”

Moragada walked over to the deceased Dunmer who had hired them to protect him. Grunting, he kicked the body over, flipping it face up. The Redoran noble’s extravagant robes were covered in blood and soot, and ripped down the middle. So was his torso. 
“We’ll get the other one next time.”

Stithulf looked at his companion, nodded grimly, and sighed. 

“Right. Next time.”

The two began again to loot the bodies. 

Stithulf looked at the assassin thoughtfully. 

“Well, it’s not the Tong.”

Moragada grunted over his shoulder.

“Of course not.”

 He was prying their former employer’s moonstone dagger off of his hip. Stithulf searched the assassin’s pockets, and then the folds of their tunic. They wore a thick black cloth bodysuit; enough to protect against small arms, but still almost as light as regular clothing. Probably enchanted, Stithulf noticed. He also noticed their weapon: an ebony dagger, engraved with images of skulls and snakes. He whistled, then yelled back to Moragada.

“They may not have been the Tong, but these were no run-of-the-mill raiders, either.”

He reached into the layers of the assassin’s collar and found a small, folded piece of paper. He unfolded it and began to read.

 As his eyes scanned the letter, his brow furrowed, and a look of concern formed across his face.

“Molag’s balls...”

“What is it?”

Moragada had walked up behind Stithulf, and was reading the strange note over his shoulder. He scowled as he did so.

“This makes no sense…”

Both stood and looked at what they knew was a hit contract, specifying the target to be eliminated: Sehr Dernas, councilor of House Redoran. But what they were focused on was the sign-off on the bottom of the page:

“*This deed shall be done, in the name and service of Sithis. Thus commands The Night Mother.*”

                       **TWO DAYS EARLIER**

“So? I won’t ask again; there are other sellswords in Blacklight. A surplus, actually.”

“Then why seek us out?”

Stithulf looked at his friend worriedly. Sometimes he wondered if Moragada actually *wanted* to find jobs.

“We have a saying in Snow-Throat, Mor: don’t look a friendly Dovah in the mouth.”

The Nord and his Orc companion sat at a back table at a cornerclub, across from House Redoran councilor Sehr Dernas, who was flanked by two members of his personal guard. The small-statured Dunmer pursed his lips.

“No, no. Your friend is right.”

The councilor sighed.

“I need someone a bit… let’s say ‘unconventional’.”

Moragada remained stone-faced, but there was annoyance in his voice.

“Do elaborate on how and why that’s not an insult.”

Dernas let out a short, sharp laugh - a shrill sound that was stifled as quickly as it had emerged. He leaned on the table towards the two mercenaries, and lowered his voice.

“There are hundreds of sellswords in Resdayn that I could hire for protection. Mephala’s sake, I have my own personal guard! But…”

He leaned back in his chair again.

“Your reputation precedes you. You two have been all over. Taken on all manner of beast and brigand. And I’m traveling to somewhat uncharted territory.”

He smiled wistfully.

“Bleakrock Isle.”

Moragada looked at Stithulf, who shrugged. Then he looked back to the councilor.

“Never heard of it.”

“I’m not surprised. It was razed by pyromancers long ago - 2nd Era, actually - and then again during the Second Great War, by Aldmeri troops who discovered an outpost of Snow-Throat militia had made camp there. It was never repopulated; it hasn’t even been labeled on maps since the end of the war.”

Stithulf raised an eyebrow.

“So why go at all?”

Dernas’ smile erupted into a full-on grin.

“They say Falmer used to live there - back when they were civilized. I’m a bit of an… amateur enthusiast of their culture.”

Moragada snorted.

“So why would you need protection to go to an abandoned island? Sounds like nothing too dangerous. Unless you’re afraid of some… exotic wildlife?”

The Orc smirked as he said the last two words, a barely discernible tug at the corner of his mouth. Dernas stared at him, unamused.

“There’s nothing *inhabiting* the isle. But the terrain is unfamiliar. And there may be some trouble on the journey there and back. You see, I’ve recently… well let’s just say I’ve *offended* the Temple of Reclamations…”

“…and they’ve sent their legally sanctioned assassins after you,” Stithulf finished. 

“The Morag Tong.”

The Nord smiled.

“I hear they’re quite good at what they do.”

Dernas frowned.

“I’m beginning to reconsider my proposition.”

Moragada leaned in.

“To the point: you need escorts who are used to traveling in unusual terrain, and who are brave or foolish enough to take on the Tong.”

Dernas nodded.

“More or less. I can travel through Blacklight without issue, but once we’re off-shore, my protections will be considerably less robust. On the island, even less so. Given, the likelihood of them following me *to* the isle is fairly slim; my primary concern is the distance between.”

Stithulf chuckled.

“You think they’ll attack you at sea? I didn’t that that was their forte.”

Dernas looked at Stithulf flatly.

“It isn’t.”

The councilor sighed, and motioned for his guards to leave the club ahead of him. He rubbed his temples.

“I am a wanted man. The Morag Tong will come after me; you can count on that. I am leaving for Bleakrock Isle, *today*, and I am taking either you two, or the Reavers waiting outside.”

He spread his hands.

“So?”

Moragada and Stithulf looked at each other, and then back at the councilor. The Nord spoke.

“Councilor, you’ve got yourself two… unconventional bodyguards.”

Dernas looked at his new protectors.

“Indeed.”

                                          ***

The group sailed in the councilor’s ship: a bug-shell vessel designed, as most high quality ships from Resdayn were, by House Sadras, with their signature chitin hull and silk sails. The journey to the shore had been uneventful, with nothing hindering them other than a couple of wild Nix-Hounds. Moragada sat on the deck meditating, his sword in his lap. Stithulf cleaned and aligned his crossbow, and took inventory of his various alchemically engineered bolts. Dernas sat in his quarters, with two bonemold-clad guards stationed outside - the same two from the club, Stith realized. Probably his elite guardsmen.

Moragada sighed in frustration and opened his eyes. He’d had his concentration broken… again. The same distraction as last time. 

“Damn that machine!”

He was speaking of the councilor’s Dwarven automaton, a sphere centurion. It turned out that having an interest in Falmer culture somewhat necessitated an interest in the Dwemer as well, and Dernas had recently acquired his oversized toy from a Dwemer goods vendor in Snow-Throat. It now rolled about the deck, performing a patrol routine, steam hissing and gears clanking all the while. Moragada finally gave up on his meditation, and walked over and sat on a crate across from Stithulf.

“Why hire us if he’s going to bring his brass bodyguard?”

Stithulf regarded the machine briefly, and then returned his attention to his work.

“I think it’s more of a novelty than anything; assuming it’s authentic, that thing is hundreds of years old.”

Mor glared at the novelty.

“I’d say the same, if he didn’t make such a big fuss about it. ‘Faster and more effective than any man or mer.’ Hmph.”

Moragada pulled a cloth from his satchel, and began cleaning his sword. 

“I’d like to see it trade blows with you or I.”

Stithulf smiled.

“Sounds like he’s been listening to those fast-talking junk peddlers from Snow-Throat. They could sell you scrap metal and have you convinced it was a piece of the Numidium.”

As the pair sat and talked, one of Dernas’ men approached them.

“You two. The councilor wants to see you.”

Moragada stood.

“Good. I can ask him about shutting that thing off.”

The guard only glared at the Orc in response as he walked away. 

As the mercenaries entered his cabin, Dernas folded a map he was reading, placing it in a drawer in his desk. 

“Gentlemer. Thank you for obliging me.”

Moragada looked around the room, noticing the various pieces of Dwemer and Falmer weaponry hanging on the walls. Dernas traced his gaze.

“Do you like them? They’re some of the finest in my collection.”

Moragada focused on one in particular: a moonstone spear. It was masterfully crafted; graceful curving lines, feathered motifs on the spearhead, and, he noticed, a bit of gold etching on the shaft. Prayers for blessings in battle.

Dernas smiled.

“That one is a particularly beautiful piece. A Falmeri spear, late Merethic, probably used-“

“It’s fake.”

Dernas let out his short, shrill laugh again, but a look of disgust painted his face.

“I’m sorry?”

“It’s fake.”

Moragada pointed at the spearhead.

“See the feather detail? This is Altmeri. Falmer saw Auri-El as the god of the sun, and their crafting motifs reflected that. And this gold here, on the shaft; it’s Falmer writing, but they wouldn’t have used gold. They favored Ebony for prayer etching, especially on Solstheim, which is where I’m assuming you bought this from.”

“…Yes.”

Dernas’ look of disgust had contorted into a scowl, but Mor either didn’t notice or didn’t care, and kept talking.

“Indeed. Altmeri, early Fourth Era; probably used in the First Great War. The etchings were added later, to make it appear Falmeri. A common trick.”

Stithulf would have laughed, had it not been for the fact that their employer looked ready to grab the counterfeit spear off of the wall and run Moragada through with it. Not that he could, but he looked ready to try.

“I’m sure you’ll find a replacement on Bleakrock, councilor. If your sources are correct, that is.”

Dernas sniffed, and regained his composure.

“Yes, well. I didn’t summon you here to evaluate my collection. I have some news.”

He took a Dwemer puzzle cube out of his desk and began to fiddle with it. Stithulf noticed that the councilor didn’t seem to have the slightest idea how to even begin solving the actual puzzle.

“It seems my friends in the Temple have forgiven me. I received word via courier just before we cast off.”

Moragada glared at Dernas.

“And what does that mean?”

Dernas smiled.

“It means that the Morag Tong won’t be troubling us on this voyage.”

“Good. An easy job, then.”

“Yes, it is.”

Dernas finally got a piece of the puzzle cube to move, and fidgeted with it absentmindedly, repeating the same movement and getting nowhere.

“In fact, it will be so easy that I wanted to inform you that I’ll be cutting your pay in half.”

Moragada stepped forward, placing his hands on the councilor’s desk.

“And you tell us this *now*?”

Stithulf joined his friend in front of the desk, the Nord’s imposing figure towering over the seated Dunmer.

“You hired us for a job, councilor. You can’t back out.”

Dernas waved his hand.

“I’m not reneging on our agreement, I’m simply altering it. Surely you understand. If there’s no danger-“

Moragada interrupted.

“If there’s no danger, then you wouldn’t have brought us. You’d have told us this in Blacklight. You have a purpose for keeping us. What is it?”

Dernas stopped fiddling with his puzzle and frowned. He looked at Moragada.

“I… hm.”

He sighed.

“Fine. I was not… entirely honest about the island. There have been reports of raiders. Vagabonds, seeking their fortune and settling on the unclaimed land.”

“So you thought you could get us to agree to a pay cut, and pretend that the settlers were news to you.” Stithulf replied. He looked at Moragada.

“How much would you wager that the Tong was never after him in the first place?”

Moragada stared at the councilor as he replied to Stithulf.

“I’d stake our pay on it.”

Stithulf shook his head.

“The Morag Tong, attacking at sea. I knew that didn’t sit well.”

Dernas’ gaze darted between the two angry sellswords, and he began to stammer.

“I… well… l-listen-“

Moragada straightened, and grabbed the spear off of the wall. Dernas’ eyes widened in fear.

“Guards!”

Before the word had left the councilor’s mouth, Moragada had jammed the spear inside the frame of the door, barring it shut. The two guards outside began pounding on the door, yelling to the councilor. Stithulf readied his crossbow, aiming it at the doorway. Moragada approached Dernas, who drew a moonstone dagger from a sheath on his belt.

“Stay back, beast!”

Mor swiftly grabbed the Dunmer’s wrist with his left hand, and pried the dagger from it with his right. He admired it in his hand.

“Now *this* is genuine Falmeri. Beautiful piece.”

He dropped it, and grabbed the collar of Dernas’ robe. Stithulf continued to watch the door, which had begun to splinter. 

“Let’s hurry it along, Mor.”

Moragada pulled Dernas close.

“Listen closely, councilor. We were hired to escort you. We are *going* to escort you. We will be *paid* to escort you. And we will be paid *full price*.”

Dernas’ face turned from fear to confusion.

“You… you still want the job?”

Moragada frowned.

“We are already halfway to Bleakrock Isle. By the time we turned around and sailed back to Resdayn, we would have lost two days’ worth of work.”

He let go of the councilor’s robes.

“We will escort you, as agreed.”

The door split into two pieces, the spear wedged in the frame the only thing holding it up.

“Or, Stithulf could test his exploding bolts on you and your guards.”

Stithulf looked back at Dernas and grinned.

“Designed them myself. Always wanted to try them out.”

Dernas looked at Moragada, and began to laugh; not the short, restrained one from before, but a prolonged shrieking cackle. 

“Oh, I forgot what fun it is, dealing with mercenaries.”

He yelled to his guards.

“Guards! It’s alright! Cease your attack!”

The guards stopped breaking the door down, and Stithulf lowered his crossbow. Moragada picked up Dernas’ dagger and held it out to him.

“We have a deal, then.”

Dernas dusted his robes off and straightened himself.

“We do. Full price.”

He took his dagger from the Orc, sheathing it. Moragada grunted, and walked to the door. He grabbed the spear and pulled it from the doorframe in one motion, then hung it back on the wall. Dernas’ honor guards watched Moragada and Stithulf as they walked back onto the deck, then rushed inside to check on the councilor. Stithulf chuckled.

“Well I suppose this *is* going to be an easier job now.”

Moragada nodded.

“Indeed.”

Stithulf shook his head.

“The Morag Tong… sailing out to sea to kill some councilor. Ysmir’s beard…”

                                          ***

Dernas had not been lying about the isle; it was utterly scorched, the miles of ash-covered fields only broken by the occasional blackened tree stump. Moragada and Stithulf walked in front of the councilor’s transportation: a Dwemer steam-chariot, which had been loaded in the cargo hold of the ship for the journey. It hissed and creaked, its massive wheels turning slowly as it crawled over the barren land. The steam centurion rolled just ahead of it, its carved face staring blankly forwards. Dernas’ two guards stood inside the chariot on either side of him, brandishing steel-tipped spears. Dernas had smugly addressed the two mercenaries as he’d climbed onto his transport, informing them that there was simply no room for more than three aboard the chariot. “Just as well,” he’d said. “We need someone to scout ahead.”

Moragada scanned the horizon, noting the distant columns of smoke; no doubt from settlers encampments. The nearest was perhaps ten miles out, and a good distance west from the direction they were traveling in. The side of the isle they had landed on was as-of-yet uninhabited; none of the predominantly wealthy citizens of Blacklight were desperate enough to sail to such barren lands in search of a homestead. By the look of it, the crews journey would be a solitary one. They traveled on what clearly used to be a road, with ditches still lining either side of the path. Their destination, a strip of snow-capped mountains, lay about a day’s journey ahead of them. There was where they may encounter trouble; Falmer were known to live in the mountains, and raiders and treasure hunters would know this.

Stithulf suddenly kneeled and raised his hand in a signal for the group to stop. The carriage creaked to a halt, but the automaton kept rolling, moving past Moragada, who gave it a sharp kick.

“That means stop, scrap heap.”

Dernas stood and yelled from his chariot.

“Don’t do that again unless you’re willing to pay for that!”

Stithulf hissed.

“Quiet!”

He touched the ground, and then brought his fingers up to sniff.

“Oil.”

He looked at Moragada, whose hand now rested on the handle of his sword.

“Dwarven oil. But I don’t see any-”

Dernas interrupted him.

“Can we continue on, please? We have quite a way to go, and I assure you some oil in the road isn’t going to hinder this piece of machinery.”

The steam centurion hissed, and then began to roll forward again, obeying its masters words without understanding their context as a question.

Moragada looked around, searching for any signs of life. Stump. Rock. Stump. Ash. He sighed in frustration. Nothing moving except for the stupid automaton, which continued rolling slowly down the road. Down the road, where there was nothing but… Moragada’s eyes widened.

“Stop! Stop you worthless-“

**WHOOSH**

Moragada squinted, trying to see through the smoke. He recoiled as flames flared up next to him, licking at his armor. Too slow. There had been a fire rune in the road, barely visible on the blackened ash. The centurion had set it off, and then it had caught the oil trail, setting the chariot ablaze. Stithulf aimed his crossbow, sweeping from left to right, trying to see something, anything through the smoke. Mor drew his sword, looking around for danger and listening for anyone from his group.

Suddenly, a scream cut through the smoke and flames; Dernas, somewhere near the chariot still, having by some miracle or divine favor dismounted it before it ignited.

“Help! Orc! Nord! M… Morada? Stiff wolf? Oh damn it to the Ashpit, just help me!”

Moragada began to walk through the smoke towards the councilor’s voice. Stithulf did as well, still circling to look for enemies. The smoke was unnaturally thick; Stithulf realized that the oil must have been alchemically altered to produce more of it when it burned. Whoever set this trap was a professional. 

Moragada heard movement to his left, and spun around, swinging his sword towards it in a wide arc. A figure had sprung from beneath a pile of ash, lunging towards him. As Mor brought his blade around, the figure ducked beneath it with impossible speed, throwing up ash as they did so. Moragada’s eyes squeezed shut in pain, but he had already begun his next swing by instinct, bringing his sword straight downwards towards his assailant. He felt it glance off of a small blade - a dagger. He felt the arm holding the dagger buckle with the force of the blow, heard a sharp crack. Mor’s eyes cleared, and he looked around, but the figure had vanished into the smoke. Hurt, for sure. Probably a broken arm. But that wouldn’t stop them, he knew. They were too well-trained for that.

A scream echoed out - Dernas again. But this time there were no words, only a piercing shriek, followed by a gurgling sound. Stithulf was close, but he knew what the sound meant; he had heard it from many men and mer, but never from a client. It was the sound of life leaving one’s body. Knowing the councilor was lost, he determined to make his killer share his fate. He let bolts fly in the direction of the noise, rapidly firing and reloading; one, two, three. He heard a sharp gasp, and then a muffled thud as two bodies fell to the ground. Then he heard the sound of blades colliding; Moragada had found another of the assassins. Stithulf didn’t dare fire for fear of hitting his friend. The smoke was clearing, but not fast enough.

“Mor!”

Moragada clashed blades with the assassin again. This one had a shortsword, and fared slightly better than the first. He could see them better, too, but that meant they could also see him. They were fast, parrying and dodging his blows with ease. He kept pressure on them, swinging relentlessly and forcing them to stay on the defensive, but he knew he couldn’t keep this up for much longer. He looked around, searching for an out, but saw nothing but… the automaton. The piece of junk was still functioning, clunking around blindly with half a body. Coming towards him. Moragada turned towards where he’d heard Stithulf yell from, and shouted back.

“Stith! The automaton!”

Stithulf looked around, and spotted the machine. Moragada’s voice rang out again.

“Time to test out your new bolts!”

Stithulf understood, and quickly loaded his crossbow with the projectile Moragada had forged based on his design; a hollow-tipped bolt filled with fire salts and coated in dwarven oil. Moragada desperately swung at the assassin, quickly losing steam. His opponent could tell, and was slowly turning the tide, forcing him to adopt a more and more defensive stance. Stithulf yelled to him.

“Tell me when!”

Moragada answered before Stithulf had even finished the question.

“Now!”

The assassin heard the exchange, and knew something was amiss, but it was too late. Moragada put all of his force into a bash with the side of his blade, and then kicked the assassin backwards, right into the path of the approaching automaton. Moragada dove onto the ground as Stithulf fired his crossbow, and the bolt found its mark. An explosion erupted from the broken centurion, sending pieces of it flying in all directions. Moragada winced as a shard of brass found his shoulder, and Stithulf shielded his eyes from the flash. The assassin Mor had been fighting vanished, without a trace.

                                         ***

Stithulf still stared at the note.

“Well, it explains why they were so well-trained.”

Moragada shook his head.

“But why were they here? This isn’t Potentate territory. And even if it was, why would Helseth want a Redoran councilor dead?”

Stithulf folded the note and tucked it into his shirt.

“I’ve heard rumors - more like scary stories, really - of Dark Brotherhood cells that operate outside of Helseth’s control, functioning the old way: taking contracts from whoever is willing to pay, and answering to matriarchs that preside over certain regions.”

Stithulf held out the assassin’s dagger to Mor, who took it and examined it closely.

“It looks like the scary stories were true. This is a ceremonial dagger. These etchings are meant to dedicate its victims to Sithis.”

He scoffed and handed the dagger back to Stithulf.

“The Brotherhood never was fond of subtlety.”

Stithulf stood and dusted the ash off of himself.

“So, what do we do now?”

Moragada bent down and used the councilor’s dagger to cut a piece of his robe off, wrapping it around his shoulder like a bandage.

“Now we return to the ship, tell the crew what happened, and sail back to Blacklight. Then we take our reward from the councilor’s collection. I’m sure there are enough authentic pieces to equal out to our pay.”

Stithulf looked thoughtfully at the destroyed automaton for a moment, and then began unloading the Dwemer bolts from its crossbow. He chuckled mirthlessly.

“We’ve never botched up a job this badly before.”

Mor stood looking at the dead councilor.

“And we won’t do it again.”

Stithulf stood and walked over to his friend, standing beside him. He placed his hand on the Orc’s shoulder.

“We’ll get them *all*… next time.”

Moragada stared grimly at the only contract they had ever failed.

“Next time…”

                                     **END**
