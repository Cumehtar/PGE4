**This is the White-Gold Tower Guard Battalion's recreation of events leading to the recent spread of "The War of the Two Emperors" pamphlet spread around Tamriel, recently declared contraband in the Potentate, formed from various testimonies.**

*It is nighttime in the Topal Bay. A lone Redguard waits outside a cavern, holding his weathered lantern. He is wary, constantly looking around for any law enforcement.*

*Finally, a figure reveals itself through the dim light, and leaves the cavern.*

Breton Man: "This **really** is the last one." *He says, stumbling his way across the gravel path as he's carrying a large and seemingly heavy crate towards the Redguard*

Redguard Man: "This better be worth it. We are the last foreign vessel to sail out of this port, you know."

Breton Man: "Oh, it'll be worth it. You will find a good buyer for this, I assure you."

*The Breton lays down the crate on the ground, and cracks it open with his dagger. He begins to ruffle through the crate, which seems to have things like ores, bars and mild trinkets. After a while, he lifts out a parchment, with text on it. Possibly a page from a book.*

*The parchment is notable. Beyond it's text are beautiful ornamental decorations - red diamonds linked with flower decorations are on the sides of the page, while on each corner there is what looks like a snake's head. The left side of the parchment looks like it was torn out in a hurry, without any care.*

Breton Man: "Just read it, I promise."

Redguard Man: "I..." *The Redguard looks around, embarrassed*

Breton Man: "Ah." *He takes the parchment. Did he really expect a pirate to be able to read?*

*Ahem!*

"...and, so it was on the last day of his Imperial Majesty's battle with the Old Dragon upon the Hill of Bloodsnakes, west of Castle Sutch-by-Akavir, that we, the grenadiers, the cavaliers and the bannerets gave up our pursuit in exhaustion, and returned for decimation by his Imperial Majesty's commandant's hands. The Old Dragon savored his victory, as later we who survived the punishment could see from our tall battlements his parade and coronation as Emperor of Akavir. Fashioning himself a new crown from Akaviri jade, gold and the never before seen crystals of the East Coast, we watched him as his Snakeman knights and consorts and many offsprings carried his frail lich-like body towards the floating seat of the Iridescent and Imperial. In fear of Akatosh striking us, we dared not fire our arms at him. In our hearts, instead, we prayed: "O Uriel, O Glorious Dragon of Auld Tamri-El, whomst didst poison thy covenant, thine serene and sublime line?"

*After the Breton finishes his reading, the Redguard looks him in the eyes.*

Redguard Man: "Is this some kind of joke?"

Breton Man: "N-No! Believe me. This will get you a lot of money, with the right buyer."

Redguard Man: "What kind of dandy would be interested in this gobbledygook?"

Breton Man: "I am glad you asked. Apparently, many. Seek my friend, the Altmer bookwriter Umdegaunriel. He resides in his shop, in the north part of Orsinium. He has a keen interest in these kinds of... conspiracies, works of fiction. He puts them into readable book or pamphlet form, spreads them around, and makes a lot of money off of it. You will too."

Redguard Man: "If you say so. If this doesn't turn out like you said, the crew will come back to collect."
