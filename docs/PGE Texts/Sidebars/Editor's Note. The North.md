"The North" is a phrase commonly used to describe a large and vague region of Tamriel: a region that is generally "north". But what defines this region is less clear.

Today, the nations often agreed to be of the North are the [[Snow-Throat Commonwealth]], the Kingdom of [[Greater Wrothgaria and Karth]], the [[Druadach Kingdom]], and the Free City of [[Orsinium]]. [[Resdayn]], especially the northern reaches, may be included on occasion, as well as the most northern cities of the [[Iliac League]].

Historically, the North denotes Tamriel north of the Jeralls: a geographic distinction, one in which Cyrodiil is the starry heart, a united Nibenay and Colovia, standing separate from the Nords of Skyrim. Yet the Nords of County [[Bruma]] now proudly call Bruma, traditionally part of Nibenay, a place of the North, and even their Nibenese brethren have turned from the ordered democracy of the Guilds for squabbling moots.

So perhaps the North speaks to a form of government. Yet a Qarl from Wrothgaria will proudly declare herself a woman of the North whilst denouncing the moots of Snow-Throat, to say nothing of the Ard of Druadach and the blood rituals of the Free City of Orsinium.

So too it is with faith. "The Gods of the North" speaks of the pantheon of Nords and Giants, yet says nothing of Druadach's heresies, nor the believers of Wrothgar & Karth's cathedrals, yet those are indisputably of the North too.

Is the North defined by trade and sea? No doubt in part - in the east the Dunmer of Solstheim who have traded ash and netch for ice and boar claim kinship with the Nords of Snow-Throat and Bretons of the Great Bay, bound together as their fates are by the icy waters of the Sea of Ghosts. Yet Bruma claims to be of the North, as do landlocked Orsinium and Druadach.

Do we look farther afield for what is the North? To [[Alinor]], all of Tamriel except them is the North. In the sands of the Khajiit, North begins above Rumare. [[Argonia]] speaks of what is of the Marsh and what is not of the Marsh. Resdayn claims the North, and finds allies in this assumption in Snow-Throat.

So what defines the North? Geography? History? Government? Faith? A sea? Trade? Perhaps all of these. The North, it seems, is in the eye of the beholder, something living that changes from person to person.

Read on, then, and find your own conclusions.
