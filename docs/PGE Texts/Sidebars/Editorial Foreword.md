Dear reader, in your hands you hold the result of almost a decade-long work of the dozens of people. When our Esteemed Potentate [[Hlaalu Helseth]] came to us, the Geographic Society, to contract the writing of the new Guide, it seemed a daunting proposition. Understaffed and underfunded as we were, without the access to the Archives of [[Cyrodiil City]], we could not replicate the approach of the old Pocket Guides.

That is when we fell on the brilliant idea - this Guide was going to be something new. Not an academic exercise by reclusive scholars, it was going to be the authentic voice of the people. Tirelessly, we contacted the travelers - traders, merchants, mercenaries and pilgrims of the Potentate. Using this wealth of information, we cross-checked, and studied, and compiled. And you hold the end result in your hands.

This, our dear reader, is the voice of the citizens of the Potentate, just like you, who went before you on the same business you may want to go. It has diverse information, from the intricacies of courtly etiquette in the Blue Palace of the Kingdom of Wrothgar and Karth, to the most famous taverns of the city of [[Tear]].

Added to it are the propositions from our esteemed contributors - the [[East Empire Company]]. If you wish to see the world cheaply and safely, there is no better way than joining their ships or caravans. And if your interests are more business-oriented, they list the most profitable ventures you can invest in.

Let us explore Tamriel together.

Yours truly,
The [[Cheydinhal Geographical Society]].

*Those fat sit-at-home slugs of the Geographic Society, they took the money from both the Palace and the EEC. And paid out only meager royalties to the real authors, from what I heard. And they published only what Helseth would like to hear, to boot - none of my letters got into it. But at least it is real impressions of the people who were to the places in last decade, and not the translation of the thousand-year-old notes by Remanian missionary who didn't speak the local tongue.*
