When the Empire fell, the lords of Colovia became kings again; and kings they remain, though kings of little domain. Wracked by internal conflict, petty disputes, and savaged by roving bands of horsemen, the independent city-states have allowed the roads of the region to fall into disrepair, limiting trade and communication.

Fortunately, the East Empire Company has taken it upon itself to repair and protect the once-great trade routes of Cyrodiil and the scattered towns abandoned by the Colovian city-states. With the permission and gratitude of these communities, the Company builds roads, forts and garrisons, protecring the region amd helping to ensure safe, reliable trade from thr Gold Coast to the Potentate and beyond.

*Permission and gratitude my ass. It's extortion and everyone knows it.*

*You ask me, the Company's up to something in Colovia. I've seen the shipments they send that way - they're way more than they need for what they say they're doing. Colovia's a mess, and I think they want it that way.*
