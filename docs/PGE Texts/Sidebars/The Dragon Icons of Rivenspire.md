The image attached was part of a sermon pamphlet found in the [[Shornhelm]] Chapel’s archives, dated toward the end of 4E 233. The symbolic icons of the dragon are sometimes found as a pair, as here; others as just one of the two. These dragon prints are found throughout archives in 4E 233-250 in Shornhelm and as far east as Hoarfrost Downs, but this pamphlet appears to be the origin. Excerpt from the pamphlet is below:

*It is with great joy that we announce that a child of Akatosh has taken residence at the Doomcrag. You see, we are not the forsaken children in the moors! No, my fellows, the Children of Time are returning to Rivenspire. We now have a protector overlooking Shornhelm to remove the remaining stains of plague. Time does, indeed, heal all wounds. Proof, as well, that our Queens are blessed in the creation of Wrothgaria.*

*Time is our master. There is no greater force and we cannot fight against it. Love and beauty wither before Time. Your work and labor will dwindle and rust as Time marches on. Even learned theories will change over the course of Time. The wheel moves ever onward. In this chapel to all of the divines, remember that Time rules them all. Others fall before the great maw of Time. Do not fail to pay your respects to Akatosh.* 

*In the night, I have seen the fires. The fires! Cleansing fires have been seen on the mountains. Woe to the bandits and goblins that remain in the foothills, for they will see their doom in flight. The gold in their purses is, to a dragon, no different than silver on their skin. Both will fall before time and become nothing but dust. The plague will be cleansed by the fires of Akatosh’s kin!* 

*Remember that no matter what you have done, it is through Akatosh’s Will and Wonder that the past fades away and you can begin anew. In such ways, we will be born anew. The symbol of that new birth is here. As the plague is burned away, we will find our way again. As much as we have lost, we will rebuild. We will see wonders once more. The end is not here, but a new beginning!*

*Praise Akatosh! We are saved!*

The dragon referred to in this text, a larger dark colored one, still resides at Doomcrag. Others have been witnessed over time, but it is unclear if they also roost in the mountains near the Doomcrag. The dragon or dragons have posed little threat, so far, to the people in the valleys and shorelines of Rivenspire. However, any adventurous souls that attempt to go into the mountains rarely return.
