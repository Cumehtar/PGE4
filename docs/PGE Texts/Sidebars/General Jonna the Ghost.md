Heroine of the First Great War’s Battle of the Red Ring, General [[Jonna]] was awarded the vampire-vacated throne of [[Skingrad]]. A veteran Legionnaire, the new Nord Countess struggled to win the trust of her disenchanted subjects especially with her total dedication to interwar military preparations. Every deprivation and disaster during those years was, fairly or not, associated with the leadership of “Jackboot Jonna” which only emboldened the insurmountable nostalgia for the public cleanliness and quiet order associated with Hassildor governance. When the Second Great War began, the Countess Jonna evacuated Skingrad’s remaining civilians and resigned herself to a sacrificial charge against the Dominion. Rumors abound that the Jackboot still marches on against the Aldmeri in similar aetherial unlife. The nightly haunting of Skingrad by the specters of its erstwhile occupiers is punctuated by the rallying ride of General Jonna the Ghost and her own ghastly garrison who chase the invaders from the city before dawn’s first light. Urban legends insist Janus Hassildor saved Jonna from her untimely demise; plucked her from a futile fight and, when plague consumed her mortal body, he preserved her soldierly spirit forever in spectral form to lead Skingrad’s armies for eternity.
