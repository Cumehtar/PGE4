*[[Aldrich Laritch]], allegedly of Skingrad, was a notable wanderer and itinerant merchant in the late 4e200s and early 4e300s. Laritch claimed to hail from [[Skingrad]], a claim that is impossible to verify, as no one from Skingrad has been able to recall him before tales of his travels reached the city-state.* 

*Whatever the truth of his origins, Laritch’s travels became the stuff of myth and folklore, though it is likely little of it is true. Laritch’s own journals are remarkably succinct and factual, recounting stories and rumors he had collected alongside descriptions of cities, towns, and peoples he had met. Some of these rumors - such as the Trinimac-worshipping Altmer of [[Orsinium]] - have since been proven true, whilst others - hidden libraries of the Dwemer buried beneath the sands of Hammerfell, wandering islands in the ocean, great hoards of treasure hidden since the Plague - remain unverified, though not for lack of effort. Many adventurers in the years since Laritch’s apparent demise at the hands of Bjoulsae raiders in 4e320 have used his travels as a guide, seeking fame and fortune.*
