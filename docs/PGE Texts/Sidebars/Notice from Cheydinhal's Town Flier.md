*Notice posted in Cheydinhal’s town flier:*

An official agreement has been reached with Count Harald Carvain and Bruma’s Moot regarding passage to the Shrine of Azura from Cheydinhal. Henceforth, those faithful wishing to worship at the Shrine must depart from Cheydinhal’s east gate after paying a small fee to the Institute for Safe Passage to Foreign Religious Sites and hiring officially sanctioned guides from the Porter’s Guild. At the border of County Bruma pilgrims will be required to undergo a search for concealed weapons, spying magicks, and plague before admittance to the Commonwealth. From there, worshippers will be allowed to stay in the Commonwealth for a period of no more than a fortnight under threat of prosecution, and allowed to worship at the Shrine for no more than a week. After exiting the Commonwealth, pilgrims will be required to pay an additional fee to the Institute for Safe Passage to Foreign Religious Sites and hire guides for their return journey to Cheydinhal.

*A note in [[Yzmul gra-Maluk]]’s hand: As I understand it, the only thing the County insisted on was the border search. Everything else was added by the Institute and the Guild.*
