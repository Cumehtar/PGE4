The army and navy of the Commonwealth, much like the government, appear a mess to outsiders: nonstandardized, self-organized, and unruly. In some regards, this is true, in others, the citizen-militias form a perfectly effective fighting force.

The militias are successors to the fighting forces of Skyrim that came before, the wandering brotherhoods of history, and the Imperial Legions. Organized into groups ranging in size from 10 to 100 soldiers, these groups are theoretically capable of coming together to work as a single, unified force. In practice, these bands are largely self-contained, self-equipped, and self-organized: officers may be elected or commissioned by moots, recruitment is nonstandardized, and equipment is varied. Attempts by national moots to organize the system have been of limited effectiveness.

The most common arms of a militiaman are a sword or axe, a shield or buckler, a dagger, and a crossbow and bolts, both normal and magical. Many will also carry longbows, greatswords or greataxes, and javelins or spears.

For armor, most will wear a gambeson and chain, armor in the style of the old Dawnguard, or Nordic housecarl-style steel, balancing cost and weight with effectiveness and mobility. Troops of Orcish descent or commissioned by Orcish moots may be equipped with heavier armor.

The Commonwealth boasts few battlemages. Instead, there is a profusion of hedge wizards among the militias: lesser in talent and cability, but many in number. In addition, the widespread usage of magical and alchemical crossbow bolts means that even the average soldier will typically have some amount of destructive capability at their disposal, for better or worse.

Most notably, the militias of the Commonwealth contain Giants, a force not seen in the militaries of any other nation. These massive soldiers are fearsome sights: some have chosen to deck themselves in steel and leather, wielding swords and hammers as large as a man, others carry ballistae meant for ships as easily as their comrades carry their own crossbows.

In total, the militias of the Commonwealth are poorly suited for massed battlea, but perfectly suited for operating without supply lines, in skirmishes, ambushes, or guerilla warfare, and in holding chokepoints and serving as defense forces for their homeland.
