Life in the city of [[Southpoint]] is one of stark contrasts. On the seaside docks merchants of many cultures ply their wares, and the taverns produce so much alcohol that even the canah birds are often drunk. Watching your coinpurse at all times is not merely good advice here, it is as basic a rule as breathing air. The local thieves run rampant across the roguish port, much to the chagrin of the growing intellectual elite.

The installation of the great ingenium workshop was a minor miracle, worked by a local clique of psychomancers determined to give their home a better name than that of banditry and cheap wine. Many superstitious commoners were aggrieved by the idea of bringing the soul industry at last to the Free Republic of Southpoint when the council first began discussing the matter roughly three decades ago. Some of these religious partisans instigated a minor riot as the old, dilapidated buildings* were demolished to make room for the workshop. Nevertheless, economic progress triumphed over rigid spiritual traditionalism once more.

A new industrial and academic vigor has grown around the workshop. The district of the city which was formerly known as Old Town, only relevant for the ancient cathedral which was of minor interest to scholars and pilgrims, became the resplendent Soul Square. A School of Psychomancy, increased proliferation of enchanted items, increased automation. The city of Southpoint may just yet be the beacon of civilization in the Baandari Wilds, if only it can deal with the criminal element.
