The canton of [[Cropsford]] is the heart of the Potentate’s agricultural district. Stretching almost from Lake Rumare to the Silverfish River, the canton is bisected by the Corbolo River. Once neglected by generations of mismanagement, this most productive part of Nibenay was revived by the policies of the Potentate after the [[Second Great War]].1

The canton provides the dragon’s share of the Potentate’s rice, saltrice, corn, and soybeans, as well as a large portion of duck and freshwater fish, both farmed alongside rice in a three-crop system. Such a system provides easy pest control and natural fertilizer.

Uniquely among the Potentate’s cantons, Cropsford coexists as a canton and goblin homeland. An agreement reached with native goblin tribes early in the days of the Potentate granted a significant amount of autonomy and recognition of their rights and land ownership. Today, goblins own more than half of all privately-owned land in Cropsford and make up three-quarters of both farm owners and workers. The most dominant goblin tribe in Cropsford is the [[Hand Biters]], formed from a union of the Rock Biter and Bloody Hand tribes in 4e231.2

The town of Cropsford itself has grown significantly since the days of the Plague, becoming a city in its own right. During harvests, the population booms as centralized processing of crops draws workers and buyers alike. The town is also home to the Cropsford University of Agriculture, Technology, and Phytomagic, a combination of research institution and college, sister college to [[Cheydinhal]]’s Campus of Administration. Research and development at the University focuses on advanced automation of agriculture and ways to integrate magical disciplines into crop production, from seeding to processing.3

*Sketches of the University. The campus sits on a rise to the west of the town, overseeing a vast array of fields dedicated to the college’s research. Three arcologies, identical to [[Port Katariah]]’s though much smaller in scale, sit to the south.*

In addition to the University, Cropsford is the site of the Potentate’s Annual Tamrielic Fair: a showcase of magic, technology, culture, advancements and wonders from across Tamriel and beyond. Held each summer, the Fair draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, with spectacles for people of all ages. We hope to see you there!4

1. _Cropsford’s revival started in the days of the Medes, not the Potentate. And the greed of the Nibenese nobility patting themselves on the back for reviving it is what caused it to be neglected in the first place._
    
2. _The deal with the tribes was made before Helseth took power. His lordship probably wishes it was never made - it’s allowed the tribes to act as an unofficial Farmer’s Guild, threatening to strangle production in order to get favorable policy to pass._
    
3. _Everyone knows the Cropsford campus is where real work is done. The Cheydinhal campus is where you go to learn politicking. The things coming out of the University aren’t always stable, though - I heard they need constant supervision, and one intended to kill pests killed a tax collector. They’re also desperately trying to get the Katariahn arcology model to work - not with much success._
