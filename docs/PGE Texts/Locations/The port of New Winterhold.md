*Traders sailing along the northern coast of the Commonwealth are advised to put in at the port of New Winterhold. The port was founded after the Silver Plague in a successful attempt to reinvigorate the city of Winterhold, formerly a decrepit collection of shacks and ruins huddled around the College. Today, the port is one of the most important stops along the northern trade-lanes: the College of Old Winterhold regularly has enchanted items for purchase and export, highly sought-after Winterhold soaps may be bought from artisans, and food supplies can be restocked with fresh fish, horker, and whale.* 

Nice place to stop for a drink and some supplies, but it’s too damn cold to want to stay long. The old college is quite a sight, and the master wizard even gives tours to visitors. Their librarian is an old orc, which is strange to see this far north in the Commonwealth. He told me he’s been here since Old Winterhold, when it was a ghost town and the college was closed to the public. I said he’s old, but he’s not that old. He wasn’t amused. The famous Winterhold soap is a waste of coin. They all smell strongly of moss or juniper, and they don’t scrub as well as a good ash soap. - Yzmul Gra-Maluk
