*4E 206 - 4E 230's*

Peryite's agents begin to spread their Affliction. The [[Second Great War]] acts as a super-spreader, causing southern regions to be hit hardest in the early years (Valenwood, Elsweyr, Blackwood). The Sload arrive with cures for the Plague during the height of the pandemic, which they trade for land and citizenship.

From the Design Doc:

The Silver Plague was a Peryite-sent plague that ravaged Tamriel from 4e206 to the 4e230s, killing 1/3 to 1/2 of Tamriel in the process. The plague's roots begin with Peryite's Afflicted in Skyrim in 4e201, being used as a petri dish of sorts to develop the plague, before spreading out across Tamriel. This fact is not known in-universe, as the plague's true spread began in the south during the Second Great War. 

The Second Great War acted as a super spreader event, as battles in the south caused plague to be spread across Valenwood, Elsweyr, and the Blackwood, before spreading through trade routes around the continent. Skyrim was likely the last place the plague reached from both east and west, as the collapse of sea travel slowed the spread.

At some point during the height of the Plague, Sload arrived in Tamriel with cures, trading them for land and citizenship.

Due to the natural resistance of Argonians to disease, Black Marsh was less affected by the Plague than other regions.

Some areas, like the Imperial City, were affected worse and lost more of their population, than others. 1/3 to 1/2 is an average of the entire continent, not a hard rule for everywhere.

**Symptoms and Spread**
 * Fever, vomiting, eventual coma and death. Skin will take on a silvery tone, giving the Plague its name.
 * Highly contagious and lethal. Will kill in most but not all cases. Likely airborne?
 * Likely performs better in warmer, more humid climates than cooler, drier areas.

**Cures and Treatment**
 * Sload have some form of cures.
 * Restoration and Alchemy likely effective to some extent. Exact procedures and potions likely had to be discovered.
 * Divine intervention?
