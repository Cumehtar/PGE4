Setting guidelines:

- Avoid ethnostates. Most nations are multiracial, with Orsinium as a notable exception.
    
- Play up internal conflicts. Cultural, social, economic.
    
- National conflicts are not about reclaiming former territories or past glories, with the Yokedate as a notable exception.
    
- Avoid making excessive references to past characters. When reasonable, do - but don’t turn it into a who’s who of characters.
    
- Tamriel is big - a Mars-sized globe at the very smallest, Earth at largest. Treat the setting accordingly.
    
- The setting does not run on, and is not limited to, video game mechanics.
    
- “Yes, and…” worldbuilding. Build on, expand, incorporate ideas, but don’t throw out or replace.
    
- Remember that this is a fan project that will not necessarily incorporate every fan theory or view.
    
- Explore the “present day” of the setting and leave the events of 200 years ago as the distant, fuzzy past. 200 years later the precise events don’t really matter.
    

Rules:

- No real-world politics.
    
- No LARPing as bloodthirsty NPCs.
    
- No ret-conning setting elements you don’t like.
    
- Be civil and respectful.
    
- Moderators/founders will determine whether community submissions are consistent and acceptable for the setting.
    
- No canonizing game events. (See design docs.)
    

Posting guidelines:

- If you want to write about/expand on something, be courteous and reach out to the original poster first.
    
- Try to have correct grammar and spelling. Aim for a semi-professional approach.
    
- Tag all NSFW as such.
