As of 4e401, there are roughly 100 dragons left in Tamriel. These can be roughly separated into:

**Monastic Dragons**

Followers of the Way of the Voice, situated primarily in and around Snow-Throat in monasteries, protected by Dragon-Monks. Comprise roughly a third of all dragons, and are the largest organized group.

**Potentate Dragons**

The dragons of the Niben, allied with the Potentate. Second-largest organized group, at roughly 20 dragons.

**Odahviing's Hunters**

Patrons of the New Tongue sects of the Dragon Monks, rejecting the Way of the Voice but remaining in Skyrim. Third largest organized group, at 10 to 15.

**Dragons of the Archdiocese**

Smallest organized group, at 8 dragons, roosting in and around the White-Gold Tower. The head of this group is named Shulkunaak.

**Independent Dragons**

The remainder of the surviving dragons have spread out, sometimes simply vanishing to parts unknown. Some, like the resurrected Nahfahlaar, have taken up service as mercenaries, others, like the dragon in the Halls of the Colossus, have begun to gather mortal followers, and yet others simply roost upon mountaintops or go wherever their desires take them.
