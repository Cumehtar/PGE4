*Some confusion arose in the writer team over how to handle the issue of conflicting lore surrounding these seemingly-overlapping group. Discussion seems to have arrived at the following points.*

- "Witch" is a slightly pejorative catch-all term in Tamriel for non-academic hedge-wizardry.

- "Wyrds" are groups that exist in parts of the Iliac Bay and Wrothgaria who are largely lumped together regardless of actual ideological similarities. Some overlap with Druids, others want nothing to do with Druids. Some actually _become_ the wyrd trees. They consort with Daedra, but in a more pragmatic less reverent way.

- "Druids" on mainland Tamriel practice a religion that believes the gods are only old ghosts hanging on, that the soul should seek to dissolve or try to become one with the Earth-Bones, or transform into strange rock-wyrms. The Galenic Druids of the Systres may or may not still exist, but in smaller numbers.

- Wyresses engage in runecrafting and sigil crafting. It is less "efficient," with limited uses, but perhaps preferred in some of the rural regions where wyrds are strong and the soul economy weak.
