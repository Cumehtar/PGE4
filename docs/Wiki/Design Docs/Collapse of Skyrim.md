*The following is u/HitSquadOfGod's proposed timeline for the collapse of Skyrim and the emergence of the [[Snow-Throat Commonwealth]] and [[Greater Wrothgaria and Karth]]. Most of this will only be alluded to in-text, not stated outright.*

General Ideas:

For Snow-Throat to exist, both the Empire and the Stormcloaks must fail. Both sides must be unable or unwilling to address the issues facing Skyrim, leading to the rejection or collapse of both.

Stormcloak cause is the result of different causes aligning, not always perfectly. Religious (Talos), economic (planned Imperial destruction of Skyrim’s economy), social/xenophobic, social/”True Nord”, aristocracy attempting to uphold privileges. Death of Talos removes religious, Stormcloak command is unable/unwilling to address economic (Stormcloaks rely on new extractive economy as much as Empire does - not enough incentive to change), leaving unpopular, divisive causes to be rejected by common folk.

By the start of the game, the collapse is already underway. Hold capitals are already losing control of distant areas of holds, towns and villages are rejecting authority, trade is collapsing. Significant amounts of the populace have become displaced. The dragon crisis accelerates this.

**Timeline**

Pre-_Skyrim_:

Imperial destruction of Skyrim’s economy underway. Civil War occurring. Slow collapse as banditry becomes common, breakdown of trade.

Civil War becomes a military stalemate. Whiterun remains neutral, and this neutrality is allowed due to the importance of Whiterun’s food supply for both sides.

**4E201:**

- Beginning of _Skyrim_. Ysimr appears. Following general “minimalist run”, Ysmir is only absolutely Thane of Whiterun with Lydia as housecarl and follower.
    

**Winter 4E201-Spring4E202:**

- Treaty of High Hrothgar negotiates a peace between Empire and Stormcloaks. The actual details of this are unimportant vis a vis trading holds. This peace will hold, barring small, unofficial skirmishes.
    

**4E202:**

- Alduin defeated. Events of _Dawnguard_ likely take place, but are not important in the long run. Ysimr’s involvement not necessary, not touched on. Dawnguard and Volkihars both continue to exist after this. Other quests and plotlines occur.
    
- Continued deterioration of situation in Skyrim. Jarls begin jockeying for marriage to Elisif. Hero cults dedicated to Ysimr spring up and begin to spread. Revival of Nordic faith begins.
    
- Beginning of dragon diaspora/settlement. Blades and Ysmir begin hunting down dragons that continue attacking mortals.
    
- Last Dark Brotherhood sanctuary destroyed. Weeks later, Emperor Titus Mede II is assassinated while attending his cousin's wedding in Solitude.
    

**4E203:**

- Ysimr and Lydia go to Solstheim. Events of _Dragonborn_ occur.
    
- 24th Mid Year: Tibedetha Incident. Death of Talos, alleged ascension of Ysmir to godhood in revived Nordic faith as the true Dragonborn God and god of the mortal struggle.
    
- Stormcloak cause begins to collapse. Widespread conversions to Nordic faith occur. Windhelm loses control of the Aalto. War declared on the Dominion by the Empire. Imperial forces begin to pull out of Skyrim, leaving behind small garrisons. Imperial forces bolstered by former Stormcloak veterans accepted under an unofficial policy of amnesty spearheaded by Legate Rikke. Ulfric Stormcloak and much of the Stormcloak’s command structure rejoin the Legion and ship out.
    
- Jarl Skald of Dawnstar mysteriously dies in his sleep. Leaving behind no heirs, there is no direct successor. Dawnstar loses control of most of the Pale. A moot is formed to govern the city while a new jarl is selected.
    

**4E204:**

- A revolutionary council forms in Windhelm to govern the city and what is left of the hold. The council and its supporters are wildly unpopular, representing the worst parts of the Stormcloak cause.
    
- Jarl Laila Law-Giver is deposed by Maven Black-Briar. Lacking direct Imperial support, usage of the Dark Brotherhood, or support from the Thieves Guild, Maven is dependent on thugs to enforce her rule. Price controls on food instituted by Maven in Riften.
    
- Bruma’s chapel is reconsecrated as a temple of Ysmir.
    

At this point most holds are effectively independent of the hold capitals. Haafingar remains controlled by Solitude due to Imperial garrisons, but most cities only have direct control over their immediate surroundings. Long distance overland trade and communication is extremely unreliable outside of well-guarded routes. River and coastal trade remains moderately reliable, but trade from one end of the province to the other is rare.

**4E205:**

- An unusually harsh winter delays harvests and planting. This is the first sign of the cooling climate. Food riots in Windhelm when grain shipments from Whiterun are late. Disaffected war veterans, war orphans, and Dunmer begin forming alliances.
    
- Brina Merilis selected as jarl of Dawnstar with the support of Solitude. Merilis is forced to make concessions with the governing moot to become jarl and retain control of what remains of the hold.
    
- The Silver-Bloods depose Igmund as jarl of the Reach. Exiled to Solitude, Igmund never arrives.
    
- Beached ships near Winterhold are converted to semi-permanent buildings, signaling the start of what will become the port of New Winterhold.
    

**4E206:**

- Another harsh winter further strains Skyrim. Riots in Windhelm become commonplace as the ruling council and supporters fight the populace. Argonian dockworkers, encouraged by An-Xileel agitators, break into the city and rampage through the Gray Quarter during the summer. Repulsed by an alliance of former Stormcloaks and Dunmer, the Argonians commandeer ships and sail south. River and coastal trade is crippled.
    
- Word of plague in the south reaches Skyrim. Mass exoduses from the cities begin.
    
- Riften’s temple of Mara receives a new Dunmer priest.
    

**4E207:**

- Plague in High Rock cuts off trade from the west.
    
- Intermittent trade to and from Morrowind in the eastern half of Skyrim brings the plague north.
    
- Plague infects Windhelm, begins to spread along river trade routes. Windhelm’s council collapses.
    
- In Whiterun, Balgruuf orders the river closed at Valtheim Towers, asking for volunteers to man the towers and burn ships if necessary. While ultimately ineffective at stopping the spread of the plague, the decision delays and mitigates the impact of the plague upstream.
    
- Balgruuf abdicates as jarl and joins the exodus from Whiterun with his family and Irileth.
    
- The non-lycanthrope members of the Companions leave Whiterun, beginning the period of their history known as “The Wandering Years”. The largest group coalesces around the leadership of Farkas and Vilkas.
    
- Falkreath’s jarl and the commander of the Imperial garrison make the decision to establish a secure route to Solitude. Fighting their way north takes several months, establishing what will become known as the Legion Road. The Deepwoods Period of Solitude begins.
    

4E207 is commonly agreed to be the true end of Skyrim. In the west, the foundations of Greater Wrothgar & Karth appear with the establishment of the Legion Road and the seclusion of the royal court, while in the east the collapse of river trade, fragmentation of the Holds, and the collapse of the traditional aristocracy herald the beginning of the Snow-Throat Commonwealth. In the west, trade collapses and plague follows slowly, in the east, plague from Morrowind reaches Skyrim as trade collapses.
