*The following policy was proposed by u/Starlit_pies to handle the issue of skooma and moon sugar in the setting.*

The primary issue is that moon-sugar and its derivative, skooma, are THE drugs of the setting, and so carry a ton of contradictory roles in the established lore. Some of them may seem to come into contradiction with each other. As following:

1. Moon-sugar is a pretty significant Khajiit cultural and religious artifact, used not only in the cuisine, but in the spiritual practices. Some characterizations of it really seem to aim to remind of Dune's Spice, with all that 'natives eat it with food from childhood'. Skooma, which is much more potent, and addictive, and thus dangerous, is also sometimes controversially linked to Khajiit practices.
    
2. One of the narratives around skooma positions it as a Dunmer _corruption_ of Khajiit practices, and so aimed to raise the question of resource exploitation and all that area of colonial critique with various degrees of nuance. The allusions to the whole opium den in China and the British involvement is certainly implied.
    
3. On the opium den analogy, the theme of addiction on the personal level is certainly touched.
    
4. Both of the substances being restricted or outright forbidden in certain legal juridictions, they are both a great hook for the criminal plotlines.
    
5. Kirkbridean lore, including the OOC one had also used the theme of substance use (not only skooma, but joy-snow as well) just to drive harder the impression of the _different world_. I do not think it was for edginess, but rather to play up the legal and cultural differences, to evoke the feeling of historical novel set in the victorian age, or cyberpunk story, or anthropological essay.
    
6. Finally, they are consumable items in the games, and so on addition to the descriptions, have actual mechanical effects. How all the effects between different descriptions do not match is a separate interesting question.

So, based on all of that, I propose to lean in the 'spiritual aid' side of the moon-sugar the hardest. Maybe that's a cowardly way out, but I'd say it doesn't cause physical dependency, but may cause psychological one.

I like the Kirkbridean aesthetics of the alien-ness, and I certainly love our idea of cultural cross-pollination, so I would like for moon-sugar to be involved spiritual practices not only of the Khajiit people.

I would say, moon-sugar may have comparatively mild 'ego death' effect, a slight disconnect between the spirit and the body, an out-of-body experience.

Skooma is a tad trickier. The themes of both cultural corruption and criminal connection are both too iconic and important to loose. But my proposal is to lean more in the spiritual aspect as well. I'd say, skooma should be something like 'Fool's Chim', giving all that 'seeing tower from the side' trip, but without any real effect. Usually.

So it is terribly addictive psychologically, especially for the people in hard times looking for the easy way out. For prepared practitioners though, it _may_ be used to jump-start the enlightenment with careful preparation.

And a separate topic is the legal and societal acceptance of both substances. When writing the Potentate Customs snippet, I've somehow already assumed the regulated, but not restricted character of moon-sugar. They may even treat skooma the same way, although with even more careful restrictions.
