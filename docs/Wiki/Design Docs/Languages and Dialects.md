While the games assume everyone speaks the same language, this is likely a gameplay convenience. So, what do we propose in actuality, in our modern Tamriel?

- Potentate: Tamrielic as a first language, with Dunmeris and Ta'agra communities, and Akaviri and Ayleidoon as academic languages
    
- GW&K: Tamrielic (possibly an archaic version) as a first language, Orkish and Riekr communities
    
- Archdiocese: Tamrielic as both a communication and a liturgical language, most likely their dialect counts as the 'Standard' Tamrielic in our timeline
    
- Iliac: Tamrielic as a first language, Yoku communities in the south
    
- Snow-Throat: Tamrielic as a first language, Giant and Orc communities, Dovahzul used as a language of learning, Dovahzul-Tamrielic pidgin used to speak across communities
    
- Freehold: Tamrielic, Altmeris and Yoku spoken in different places, with Tamrielic used as a universal trade language

- Resdayn: Dunmeris as a first language, Tamrielic used as a second language, especially in the North and the South
    
- New Ayleid: Bosmeri with Ayleidoon influences? as an official language, Tamrielic spoken by many as a second or trade language
    
- 'great steppe' of Bjoulsae and Colovia: various communities with their own languages, Tamrielic with Ta'agra/Yoku/Centaur admixture as a main trade language
    
- Druadach: local dialect of Tamrielic as a first language, small communities speaking the original Nedic languages
