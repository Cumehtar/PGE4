Like the Pocket Guides created by Bethesda and Zenimax Online, the Potentate’s Guide is written from the biased perspectives of characters living in Tamriel. The main text is a series of letters about the people and places of Tamriel, edited together by the[[ Cheydinhal Geographical Society]] and the [[East Empire Company]]. (See [[Editorial Foreword]]). As such, the main text has a pro-Potentate and pro-East Empire Company bias.

The other "author" is [[Yzmul gra-Maluk]], a working-class Orc sailor born in the Nibenese Potentate who is cynical towards mysticism, the burgeoning magical industry, and authoritarian thinking in general. Her perspective favors the working class and the growing labor movements of the Guilds, but she is not consciously ideological in the sense of 21st century Earth labor movements. Her distaste for the Potentate’s ruling elite and abstract esoteric spirituality causes her to occasionally overcorrect in her estimation of the various societies encountered, at times taking a romanticized view of the Potentate’s enemies; such as the Baandari Pirate society.
