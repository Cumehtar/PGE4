The practice of magic can be roughly divided in three (or four?) different approaches - traditional craft as hedge magic, esoteric and religious practice, and applied science and engineering
    
- the 'engineering' approach to magic grows ever stronger, and is the backbone of the economy of the advanced nations of the fourth century
    
- the breakthrough of the scientific approach to magic is due to the research of yet-unnamed person or persons who brought the Newtonian-like paradigm shift and the breakaway from the Galerion perspective
    
- there may be a tension between the pure scientific research and the engineering approach as well, as the ideas of Tamriel-wide research community and proprietary 'technologies' are in the opposition.

We didn't fully flesh out the new magical paradigm, although we have proposed to draw the lines by the *sources* of magic instead of their effects of vague application areas in the following way:

- varliance (magic from the stars),
    
- psychomancy (soul magic),
    
- tonal manipulation (sound magic),
    
- deadronmancy (daedron magic),
    
- auramancy (memory magic),
    
- Geomancy (nature magic),
    
- blood magic.

Other comments:

- Magic should not completely re-invent agriculture, essentially ending world hunger. To do so would warp the setting too much. Changes should be balanced, and magic must always come at a cost.
- Some "overpowered" magic, such as the Sight, chronomancy, shadow magic, etc. should be too difficult and esoteric to be studied and used on a wide scale.  Again, it would result in altering the setting too much.
