The Dark Brotherhood has splintered into multiple factions: one, led by [[Hlaalu Helseth]], still reveres the Night Mother and does the dirty work of the [[Second Potentate]]. Other "Brothers of Darkness" led by mortal Night Mothers have splintered off and scattered across Tamriel. Shadowscales are still trained for the Kingdom of [[Argonia]].
