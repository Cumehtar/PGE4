With the headquarters in [[Cheydinhal]], the Temple combines the Imperial-style worship of Arkay with more Dunmeri ancestor cults. The Primate of the Temple sits on the [[Council of Eight]], but is mostly autonomous from the [[Archdiocese]], with [[Helseth Hlaalu]]'s support.

Brings in traditions like bonewalkers, communion with ghosts, and even some Nordic embalming practices. Works with the Laborers Guild to regulate necromancy. Some Confucian influences.

Preferred terminology: Priests are Apprentices, Journeymen, and Masters. Nicknamed  "[[Arkayn Bonecharmers]]" by some of the general populace.
