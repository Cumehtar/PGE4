After the Plague and the wholesale secession of the mostly traditionally Forebear coastal cities to the Iliac League, the Na-Totambu part of the Hammerfell is left to figure out their unifying idea outside of the traditional confrontation.

The power is structured in the curiously overlapping way, where the Emperor is the head of the traditional religion, . The executive and military power meanwhile belongs to the military governors - Yokedas, led by the Elder Yokeda. Formally, he is appointed by the Emperor, in reality, the Army is a self-ruling body, and only presents the candidates for appointment. But this convinient fiction has not being broken yet.

The day-to-day functioning of the land is overseen by the mostly elected magistrates and tribal chiefs, who have little influence on the structure above them.

The idea of what the Yokedate should be is also seen differently by the different factions - the Emperor wishes for the full restoration of the traditional Redguard religion, while the 'Young Redguard' faction in the military pushes for the cultural and linguistic approach, and had recently reintroduced the half-forgotten Yoku to the wider usage.

This faction calls back to the Hammerfell as presented in the Redguard, and the Japanese-influences themes of the Daggerfall lore, with the tension between the Emperor and the Yokedas inspired both by the Emperor-Shogun one, and Middle-Eastern Calif-Emir one. The idea of the role of the language is inspired by the Ataturk reforms of the early 20th century Turkey.
