Auridon, the Gold Coast, and parts of western Valenwood and southern Hammerfell, basically the whole “Blue Divide” sea region. In contest with the Potentate and Bloodtoil for the most ethnically diverse polity. Maritime merchant republic with Renaissance Italy-vibes, dominated by “Six Sacred Families” like the Five Great Houses of Morrowind. The Adariel Family being an Altmer family of wizard-lords, the Elsinor Family (also Altmer) being the navy, the Redguard Shraj Family control mining and agriculture, the Bosmer Camoran Family are bards and artisans, the Colovian Umbranox Family are crime lords, and the at-Reymon “family” is an order of mercenaries dedicated to Reymon Ebonarm.

The Republic is, at the Guide’s writing, economically and politically dominant, but that may change soon. They have the most shares in the Tamrielic Bank of Z’en (a combination of the IMF and the World Bank) and lead the magitek industry. If you want mass produced reality-bending devices used casually with no thought of long-lasting effects, that would be Freehold.

Religiously, the leading Altmer families prefer an esoteric cult following Xarxes and Hermaeus Mora that believes the Dragonborn was an incarnation of Xarxes. Each of the other families have their own patron deities, who they push in their spheres of influence.
