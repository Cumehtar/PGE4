Not a nation, but a catch-all term for Tamriel's sourthern coast, whose city-states, from [[Greenheart]] to [[Senchal]], serves as havens for a great number of pirate ships. Initially trained by the Tahlmor in preparation for the [[Second Great War]], those pirates now serve no master other than their own ambition. They are however tied together by their version of "[[Baandari Code]]" of the [[Baandari Peddlers]] which sets certain limits on violence and the power of the captains over their crew (in fact the code details how the captain may be overthrown should they become too unpopular). Pirate crews sometime come together to form pirate fleets when a particularly ambitious captain, usually styling themself "Commodore", manages to convince enough of their peer to follow them to wealth and glory.

The largest and most influential city of the Coast is [[Senchal]], whose [[Harbor-Duke]]s are often also commodores of the largest [[Baandari fleets]] of their time, but the freeport of Topal Island, established by the pirates themselves may soon take its place.

The population is about equal parts Bosmer and Khajiit, followed by a variety of sailors from all over Tamriel and beyond. The main isnpirations are the Barbary Coast and the Golden Age of Piracy Carribeans.
