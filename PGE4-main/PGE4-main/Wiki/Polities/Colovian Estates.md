Also known as "the Colovian Wilds" and "the Colovian Frontier". Each City (and many towns) of Colovia have become their own independent nations, while they are bound in a network of oaths and alliances to defend each other from outside threats, still occasionally fight among themselves, and each makes its own way with its own form of governance, from Skingrad's immortal vamire court, to Chorrol's line of Archdukes hoping to resurrect the Empire, to Elinhir's council of archmages. Of special note are Sutch's mixed population of human and goblin worshippers of Kynareth, the minotaur city-state of Sancre Tor and Kvatch's large Bosmeri population (indeed it became the origin point of the New Ayleid Imeprium). The main thing keeping the Estates somewhat unified is the recurring threat of nomad raids/invasions.

The main power in Colovia however, is the East Empire Company, between predatory loans to small towns, maintaining (and tolling) roads, and aggressively buying lands, the Company is slowly taking over the region and using the people as a cheap workforce.

The population is largely Colovian, with significant Bosmer, minotaur, goblin and Redguard minorities. The main inspirations are Renaissance Europe (especially the divided states of Italy and Germany) and the various East India Companies.
