*On the 24th of Mid Year, in the 203rd year of the Fourth Era, an event of immense spiritual significance across Tamriel occurred. A group of priests atop the Umbral Tower, in the city of [[Dusk]], performed a powerful ritual involving the use of an Elder Scroll they looted from the White-Gold Tower in the First Great War, and a portion of Dragon blood from Skyrim, among other implements. The aim of this ritual was to erase the very spirit of Talos from the face of history. Moons orbiting Nirn aligned for eight hours: the longest eclipse on record. Dusk was almost entirely destroyed by a burst of arcane energy. Various other calamities are said to have occurred on this momentous day, though few can agree which are true. Emperor [[Albertius Mede]] cited the incident as a* casus belli, *though his hawkish allies on the Elder Council such as [[Amaund Motierre]] and Voragiel Caro had been pushing for war with the Dominion for some time. Below are some of the stories and theories from across Tamriel of that day. - Adaria Corax, [[University of Cheydinhal]]*

*\*\*\**

**Claudius Nilus, Assistant Secretary to the Sagacious Potentate Hlaalu Helseth Ra'athim, [[Cheydinhal]]**

*That was a dark time for Tamriel, literally and figuratively. Inefficient governance in both states allowed religious zealotry to drive them into needless war and madness. Let us be grateful that we now live in an age of tolerance, that we can see both heads of the Dragon-Saint as equally deserving of veneration. The modern Potentate would never stoop to such violent lows as our predecessors, but instead welcome open debate and disagreement. Within reason, of course.*

**Marcus Permean, Theurgist, Arcane University**

*The Thalmor had hoped to excise Talos from the Divine, but they failed. Instead, a wondrous miracle occurred: the Lorkhanic moons and the Magnan sun aligned and a message was issued from Heaven that all the Divine are now of Unitary Spirit, and that Tiber, Celestial Emperor, was a representative to Man. One of many! The modern Archiocese is founded upon this Eternal Truth. Glory to Akatosh! Glory to Lorkhan! (but I repeat myself), glory to Magnus! (but I repeat myself), glory to Tiber! (but I repeat myself).*

**Elthyrra Mooring, Diviner, Alcaire**

*It is true: Talos is no more. The Thalmor sacrificed thousands of their own people to shoot him down from the Firmament with an Aetherial Bow, Elder Scroll recording the event as permanent and backdated. Sky-Mother Kynareth mourned his passing, and a great blizzard covered the entirety of Tiber’s homeland in the middle of summer. A dreadful time for all of us. Now Tibedetha is a day of sorrow rather than celebration here.*

**Torvald of Bruma, priest of Ysmir, [[Bruma]]**

*Talos may be gone, but the Thalmor failed. It will take more than a cabal of desperate elves to remove the spirit of humanity. And make no mistake, desperate is what they were - but they killed the wrong face. All they did was make sure that the true Dragonborn God would ascend - Ysmir, who walked the world and rose to his true divinity in a day of darkness and roaring, snow-throated winter.*

**Ingtar, Dragon Monk, Bleak Falls Monastery**

*The Thalmor misunderstood, and paid for their misunderstanding. Talos is but a face of Ysmir, and Ysmir is eternal. To slay the man, one must also slay the dragon - for the man and dragon are the same, are they not? Perhaps one day the elves will understand the truth of many faces, for all faces are one.*

**Chaplain Desnia Pinethorn, Primate of Auri-El, [[Kvatch]]**

*What a tragedy. The Thalmor attempted to wage war on the Heavens. All they “proved” is that we mortals desperately need Divine guidance to maintain order and stability. Auri-El the King, Magnus the Architect, Merid-Nunda the Keeper. They want only what is best for us, to follow the Divine Mandate and lead a life of proper discipline. That is why the Archdiocese is founded upon false and heretical thought, and should come back into the true fold. “Oneness” deludes mortals into believing that they, too, could one day become as Gods. Just as the Thalmor believed. The ending will be just as destructive.*

**Salethiarani, Ahemmusa Wise Woman, Rotheron**

*Thalmor? They had nothing to do with it. The alignment of the Moons and the shaking of Red Mountain was a sign from Azura: that all Resdayn must unite or be cast aside. Sul-Gandra of the Urshilaku, under the advice of his wise women, formed an alliance with the other tribes and was made Gah-Khan. When the Argonians invaded again from the south, just as the farseers had heard from the ancestors, the Gah-Khan made alliance with the Hortator of the House Dunmer. The reptiles took much of the south, but they were stopped at Narsis. One day Lady Azura will send us another champion, like the Dragonborn or the Nerevarine, to free the rest of our ancestral homelands. And that includes the lands still being plundered by the Empire. Or is it the Potentate? The name matters not, the spirit is the same.*

**Thaggia, Welkynar, King’s Haven**

*Ha, that was somethin’ alright. Damned Thalmor thought they could kill a god. Instead they blew up a whole damned city! Dusk’s still a sad vestige of its former self. It kick-started the revolution, though, so it worked out for us in the end. Spread themselves too thin in the war, and we kicked their pompous asses right out of the Eton Nir! By the Eleven Forces, I get excited just thinking about it! Let me tell you some of my grandpap’s old war stories. Next round of golden ale on me.*

**Halnach the Wolf-Voice, Vateshran, [[Markarth]]**

*The Day of Darkness is remembered with holy feasts here in the Reach. The World of Spirit and the World of Flesh became as one on that day, and the Druadach trembled from the union. The Tricky Hunter changed the skin of some of our bravest warriors, and they slew the Nords and the Bretons and the Imperials in their forts. The Forsworn had been fighting for our freedom for many an age, it is true, but that day was when the war of liberation began in earnest.* 

**Vasha, Mother Navigator, [[Gottlesfont]]**

*Of course that was an awful day, the story was passed down to me from my foremothers. The Dark Moon turning day into night for so long? It caused quite the panic in Dunei, but that is another story. A dust storm kicked up from Sentinel to Gilane, and for my ancestors it was a sign from Tava herself that a great change was coming. They began to walk new roads farther and farther from the Alik’r, and made contact with the cat-mothers from the south. When the Plague hit, our trade kept all of Tamriel united, and the mothers prospered from it. And when the mothers prosper, everyone prospers. Now Tava and Khenarthi are as one, and the Mother Navigators can make a special trip, just for you. Same low price.*

**Kallo Tallhorn, Green Prophet, Bloodtoil Valley**

*Foolishness. That is what it was. Do not believe things you cannot see with your own eyes, hear with your own ears, or smell with your own snout. This Talos… can you see him or taste him? No? Then he was never real in the first place. Tiber was just a man. If he was a good man, he would have become One with the Green. But he didn’t, because the greed of gold corrupted his soul and led him astray of the true path. What a shame, what a shame.*

**Isezara al-Verkarth, Onsite war-priestess, Hegathe**

*What more proof do you people need of the wickedness of the Elves? We who keep the memory of Old Yokuda alive needed no reminder, but perhaps this sin which outdoes even the cruelty of the Left-Handed Ones will finally reveal them to you for what they are: the devious, greedy and ill-willed children of Sep. Yes, Sep! Although the Second Serpent came to them in the guise of his father to fool them into worshipping him, we know who the Serpent That Moves Like So in the Heavens truly is. And now, look what his patronage lead them to do! They tried to murder the very spirits of Humankind! Not Talos, that feeble Nordic memory of a deluded White King, but Fierce Hoonding, Noblest Onsi and Undomitable Leki, and to do this they blackened the Moons! The very eyes of Tava, ward-mother of all Men, ripped from her. Sacrilege four times multiplied by itself! Let us give thanks to Tall Papa for smiting the Elves as he did their master in the beginning, and let us carry out his will and wipe out their scourge from this World!*

**Reads-the-Stars, Nisswo, Rockgrove**

*Ah that was quite something that the Thalmor did, wasn't it? Not the results they were hoping for, heh? They called on Sithis as the Great Destroyer and complain when he gives them his blessing? Yes, Blessing. look to the High Elves as they were: rigid, unified, turned to the past, in love with Stasis. Stasis which is worse than death, for death is part of Life, Stasis which is living as if you're not. And now look at the Altmer as they are: here merchants, here tyrants, here artists, everywhere free. Reborn and multidinous! This is the Truth of Sithis the Great Changer, that there isn't one Truth but many. We learned that lesson long ago, and now so have they. Is it coïncidence that the High Elves'* ***Fall*** *happened in* ***Dusk***\*? Perhaps even Sithis has a sense of humor.\*

**Laizuma, Centaur Trailmaker, Wilderness**

*Ah the Elves. Of all the mortals the most prone to swinging from an extreme to the other. Duality has always been their curse, perhaps it will always be so. Who today remembers how they slew Gheatus and the Ilyadi before adopting the Elder way that they had taught them? Do you remember the Madness in the East? When the very Ash cried out under the tyranny of a masked demon? Are you surprised then, than an equal and opposite Folly would Rise in the West? You should not be. They have meddled with forces beyond them, as they so often do, and a terrible price was paid for it. One that is not understood yet by the people of Dawn's Beauty. That is all I will say on the matter.*

**Henri Derre, Priest of the Eight, Northpoint**

*I will not bore you with the obvious symbolism of the eclipse lasting eight hours for the Eight Divines, as the skeptics would deny that as a coincidence anyway. Instead I will emphasize that the Talos Mistake was, indeed, a mistake. A break with sacred tradition which had horrendous consequences for us all. For millennia, from the rise of Empress Alessia to the reign of Tiber Septim himself, the Imperial Church recognized only Eight Divines. That is not to say other spirits of great power such as Magnus or Shezarr never existed, but instead that the Eight Aedra which orbit Nirn, who sacrificed themselves to make the world, who represent the Eight Virtues, who are found in almost every culture in Tamriel, are indeed the supreme Gods of the Mundus and the Gods most worthy of centralized worship. Tiber Septim’s haphazard addition to the pantheon was a lapse in judgment, one of the most grievous errors of the otherwise glorious Septim Empire. He was a great man, a Saint and an Apostle, but he was not a god. The Thalmor did not “succeed” because there was no god to kill in the first place.*

**Tumindil, Primate of Julianos, Skingrad**

*Do they still teach such nonsense in Nibenay? The so-called “Tibedetha Incident” was nothing more than a set of coincidences and cheap magic tricks. An alignment of the planets that long is indeed rare, but if you come visit the Orrery we just had installed here in Skingrad, I can show you how it might occur as a result of focused chronomancy and increased varliant activity. The Thalmor had done a similar trick before in the Void Nights. The reports of earthquakes and blizzards and sandstorms that occurred around that date indeed happened, but are falsely remembered as all occurring all on the same day due to the spiritual significance retroactively ascribed to that time period. After all, war and plague would go on to topple both of the largest political powers in Tamriel. In hindsight that day seems a good spot for mystics to claim as “the beginning of the end.” Serious historical analysis, on the other hand, will demonstrate that the fall of the Empire and the Dominion were purely mundane in causation.*

*The arcane overload brought about from the Thalmor tampering with an Elder Scroll undeniably had very real consequences for the people of Dusk, and that was a tragedy, but the larger metaphysical consequences are purely imagined by the Temple Zero ideologues gaining uncomfortable levels of influence within the Archdiocese. I do hope the Archbishop of the One will finally repudiate such superstition.*

**Morlia of Skywatch, Sapiarch, Shimmerene**

*Failed? You think they failed? Look at the Seat of Sundered Kings. The Wheel within the Wheel lies dormant, save for a handful of maggot-priests writhing in the Empire’s corpse and preaching a long-dead doctrine invented by an ape. Talos is dead, no one worships him anymore. Not the way they used to. Dragon cultists call him “many-faced” now because even they cannot deny that the oversoul of that Mannish upstart has been shattered. The Aldmeri Dominion is gone, and good riddance, but a new phoenix shall rise from its ashes. We are not done with you, child of the Niben. Once the Blessed Isles are united once more, we will carry the Divine Revolution to every shore, breaking your kings and jarls and hortators and potentates upon the stone of Anu’s Glory. Then we shall know peace everlasting. Then we shall know the New Era. Then* you *shall know the truth of* Tiber Septim's *failure.*
