Located in parts of Colovia, northern Valenwood, and Elsweyr, the dominant population is Bosmer with sizable portions of Colovians and Khajiit as well. The government is a council of sorcerer-priests, followed by a sizable clergy and a very large military. They currently have a problem of soldiers wanting money and land and the government not having enough to go around. War is probably inevitable. Class structure is somewhat Roman, somewhat Mythic Dawn. Influences are the original Ayleid Empire (obviously) the irl Western Roman Empire, and especially ole’ Mankar Camoran (but that’s a secret in-universe).

Religiously, the Imperial Cult survived with only a few bumps and scratches in Kvatch. Elsewhere, each wizard-lord chooses their favorite deity and makes it the local cult. Magnus, Auriel, and Meridia are the most popular. Daedra worship is still controversial among the Colovian subjects (Meridia has been reclassified as a non-Daedra to appease the masses), so that’s mostly kept to the forests of the southern Imperium. Y’ffre cults continue mostly unabated, but the Green Prophet cannibals of Bloodtoil are hated by the Imperium, seen as an embarrassment, and heavily persecuted.
