Some cities are like forests - they grow on their own, spreading towards water, rising tall towards the sun. You can see the old growth, ancient and covered by moss, the broad swatches left by the fires, the fresh saplings of the growing housing.

Some cities are like ships. Even standing still, they embark on the journey across the world. Their citizen-crew comes and goes, always building, repairing, maintaining, stitching up the sails of the marketplace awnings. And their underside is dark, slimy, encrusted with barnacles and in need of cleaning.

Some cities are planned and built. Even when the last stone is set and the last shingle put in place, you still see the ink on paper, the precise lines plotted with ruler and compass. If you look up, you may glimpse the eye of an architect looking at their creation.

And some cities are divine bodies, the vestiges of the power and the will of their planners, and the receptacle of the belief. In the words of Saint Vivec: *They add new doors to me and I become effortlessly trans-immortal with the comings and goings and the stride-heat of the market where I am traded for, yell of the children hear them play, scoffed at, amused, desired, paid for in native coin, new minted with my face on one side and my city-body on the other. I stare with each new window. Soon I am a million-eyed insect dreaming.*

Such cities are rare gems, and everyone knows their names. White-Gold, the dissected structure of Ayleid soul, circles upon circles, the mapping of heavens imposed on the islands of the Earthbones. Falinesti, a slow wandering giant, the reminder of what the world may have looked in the times of the first Elhnofey. Vivec, the lie turned into the truth and held off by the love to itself. All of them lie in ruins now.

Few of us dreamed to witness the act of urban apotheosis in our lifetime. And yet, if you go down the Niben river, you will arrive to it - the recently built Port Katariah. It is not shaped in vulgar symmetry, but neither does it follow the landscape slavishly. If seen from above, the city would look like a giant hook, puling a piece of land into the Niben River. The handle of the hook is a breakwater, terminating in a giant lighthouse.

The whole architecture of the city is massive and solid, with sloped walls, oblique angles, windowless outer surfaces of gray ash-cement. Covered walkways, blunted pyramids of the housing quarters. Dunmer may say it is a memory of Vivec's ziggurats, but in actuality, the inspiration was taken from the ancient blueprints of Reman's lunar settlement. Designed to withstand the magica storms of the outer Aetherus, it serves well against the weathers of the Topal Bay. Whether it will be a seasonal rain that doesn't let up for months, or the giant waves brought by the clashing currents.

The inside of the housing pyramids is the direct opposite of the outside. The brutal angularity is broken down into the mer-men-sized cozyness of a cave. Tilted twisting corridors, comfortable nooks and crannies, benches of thick softwood. The enchanted lanterns cast the pure untainted golden light of Magnus-Sun.

It serves not only for pleasure of the eye, but allows to bring the agriculture under the roof. The fruit-bearing plants cover the walls, with the streams of water running endlessly from top to bottom, filling the corridors with their soft melody. Each pyramid is a self-sufficient creature, taking only water and air to create food for its inhabitants.

The clever narrow window-slits of Alteration-infused crystal are not seen from the outside, but give a perfect view of the waves breaking against the walls of the city even in the worst storm. Together with the dampening of the sound - for the corridors are both designed and enchanted with Illusion to not spread even the softest echo - it creates an impression as otherworldly as any Daedric realm.

All taken together, the city is the perfect embodiment of the worship and belief of our Potentate. A contradiction thrust upon itself, a hardened ash-shell protecting the luxurious gardens. An artificial cliff, raised to meet every wave of challenge at oblique angle. The seed of the old novelty grown into the new tradition.

*YgM: It took some arrogance and stupidity to choose the only place on the coast where the waves can get higher than the trees, and put the city there. And it's a boring place, with the current population of soldiers and sailors rattling in the halls built for hundreds of thousands, like dried peas in a pod.*

*The sensory deprivation effect of the sound dampening doesn't help either. They tell that some of the first wave of the settlers went mad and still wander the corridors, always taking just the wrong turn. No wonder drinking is the main pastime - fortunately all those fruits make a decent shein.*

*And I don't stand for all that architectural mysticism. 'City as a divine body', my ass. Although I'm sure the guys from Port Topal would say their city is the divine geometry of Baan Dar.*
