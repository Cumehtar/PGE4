The goal of this project is to imagine a possible future of Tamriel following a series of catastrophic events, among them the fall of both the Dominion and Empire. The new states that have arisen deliberately do not follow the old provincial boundaries: most are multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, with new religions, philosophies, forms of government, and more being born of the clashes of disparate groups and the effects of the past.

Following the examples of the Pocket Guide to the Empire, First, Second, and Third Editions, as well as the Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel, this will take the form of a travel guide to the various nations of Tamriel and even beyond. Commissioned by the Second Potentate and made of submissions to the East Empire Company, the Guide is in no way truly objective. We want to strike a balance between the craziness of the PGE2 and the groundedness of the PGE3, with a focus on the political, social, economic, and religious customs of the people of Tamriel. Like the PGE1, the Guide will have a dissenting voice in the form of notes and commentary from Yzmul gra-Maluk, a disgruntled sailor from the Potentate whose views oppose the Potentate and EEC's.

Project overview threads like this will serve as a place to discuss the project, air out ideas, freeform chat, ask questions, and more.

We encourage creativity and a "Yes, and..." approach to worldbuilding (which is to say that the default attitude should be to accept other people's proposals even if they conflict with your own ideas, and to build off of them in order to make all our visions come true). When disagreement still occurs, it should happen in a reasonable, civil manner. We're all here to have fun. With that said, proposals should be somewhat plausible evolutions of the existing setting and endeavor not to contradict other proposals too much. Mods/founders will have the ultimate say in what is and is not accepted in the setting.

**Setting Guidelines**

- “Yes, and…” worldbuilding. Build on, expand, incorporate ideas, but don’t throw out or replace.
    
- Remember that this is a fan project that will not necessarily incorporate every fan theory or view.
    
- The setting does not run on, and is not limited to, video game mechanics.
    
- Explore the “present day” of the setting and leave the events of 200 years ago as the distant, fuzzy past. 200 years later the precise events don’t really matter.
    
- Play up internal conflicts - cultural, social, economic.
    
- Tamriel is big - a Mars-sized globe at the very smallest, Earth at largest. Treat the setting accordingly.
    
- National conflicts are not about reclaiming former territories or past glories, with the Yokedate as a notable exception.
    
- Avoid ethnostates. Most nations are multiracial, with Orsinium as a notable exception.
    
- Avoid making excessive references to past characters. When reasonable, do - but don’t turn it into a who’s who of characters.
    
- No "stupid good" or "stupid evil" polities.
    

While the Guide is main focus of the project, any in-universe text set in this "universe" (religious pamphlets, advertisement, political manifestoes, treatises, histories, etc.), from any point of view, is welcome. Artwork and maps are also more than welcome.

As of today, the Guide is set 200 years after the events of Skyrim, a time-span during which several events transformed Tamriel's political landscape. An attempt by the Thalmor to kill Talos known as the Tibedetha Incident caused massive and largely not-understood changes to the world, ultimately leading to the Second Great War between the Empire and the Dominion. The Second Great War was interrupted by the outbreak of the Silver Plague (a Peryite-sent epidemic comparable in scope to the Thrassian Plague or the Knahaten Flu) which lead to the collapse of both polities and most "Province-level" governments. Not as deadly but still impactful, was a major drop in temperature of the Sea of Ghosts which crippled northern sailing trade. The states that formed in the aftermath often found themselves having to focus on sea-travel and warfare, and to incorporate different ethnicities under one share identity. Technology has also improved since the Third Era, but this ideally should be represented as advances in applied magic rather than a steam-based industrial revolution.
