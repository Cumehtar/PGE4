An attempt by the Thalmor to kill Talos known as the Tibedetha Incident caused massive and largely not-understood changes to the world, ultimately leading to the Second Great War between the Empire and the Dominion. The Second Great War was interrupted by the outbreak of the Silver Plague (a Peryite-sent epidemic comparable in scope to the Thrassian Plague or the Knahaten Flu) which lead to the collapse of both polities and most \"Province-level\" governments. Not as deadly but still impactful, was a major drop in temperature of the Sea of Ghosts which crippled northern sailing trade. The states that formed in the aftermath often found themselves having to focus on sea-travel and warfare, and to incorporate different ethnicities under one share identity. Technology has also improved since the Third Era, but this ideally should be represented as advances in applied magic rather than a steam-based industrial revolution. </p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Archdiocese%20of%20the%20Divine/","title":"Chapter. Archdiocese of the Divine","text":"<p>To give an history of Cyrodiil City is to give an history of the Empires of Cyrodiil in brief, so tied are the two. The City was founded by the Wild Elves of the Heartland, around the White Gold Tower; from there they spread their tyrannical rule until the Alessian Revolt of 1E 243. Alessia the Slave-Queen naturally chose the city as capital of her new Empire, and the White-Gold Tower as her palace, as its central location made it ideally suited to the task. While the Tower's Ayleidic origins are well-documented, those of the Temple of the One are not as clear. Some have it also be an Ayleidic structure, others credit Alessia herself, or Marukh the Seer, with its erection. Regardless, the Temple would play as central a role in Cyrodiil's religious life as the White Gold Tower did in its political one, for much the same reasons.</p> <p>As the Empire grew, so did Cyrodiil City, soon known universally as the Imperial City. It was the center of Cyrodiil, the center of the Empire, the center of Tamriel and, mystics claimed, the center of the very Aurbis. From all corners of the map people flocked to its walls, and the city swelled in size, covering the Ruby Islands. At its peak, it was home to more than a million souls and perhaps half as many visitors, whether for commerce, politics or tourism. This constant flux of people resulted in a tradition of cosmopolitanism unseen anywhere else, and with it the proliferation of hundreds of cults to gods, saints and demons alike. But in the City of a Thousand Cults, the strangest one was perhaps the one promoted by the nobility and the rulers.</p> <p>Alessia established the worship of the Eight of the Imperial Pantheon, mixing Elven and Cyro-Nordic traditions, but it was Marukh who codified much of the hymns and ceremonies still in use in the modern Imperial Cult. In particular, it was him and his immediate followers who insisted that places of worship should honor all members of the pantheon. This tradition would, over the centuries, shift into the odd theology of the Alessian Order, where a seemingly infinite number of spirits were acknowledged but all understood as various guises of the increasingly abstract \"One\", the sole true God of the faith, who was usually identified with the most popular Divine of a given region, often Akatosh.</p> <p>At the center of this religious movement was the Temple of the One. While the original deity this Church was initially dedicated to (Auri-El, Shezarr, Akatosh, some even say Saint Alessia herself who was allegedly buried in the Temple) is unclear, the Temple quickly became the headquarter of the Alessian Order, and the personal stronghold of the Order's Arch-Prelate. For centuries it served as a rival power to the temporal Emperors of the neighbouring White-Gold Palace, until the First Empire dissolved into the chaos of the War of Righteousness and the Order itself was destroyed.</p> <p>Despite the Order's hold on the noble class and inteligentsia of the Empire, the common people of Cyrodiil had clung to the view that each of the Eight Divines were, in fact, separate beings. With the end of the Order, individual cults to each Divine spread throughout Cyrodiil, from ancient centers of worship, establishing the Great Chapels of the Imperial Church: of Akatosh in Kvatch, of Arkay in Cheydinhal, of Mara in Bravil, of Dibella in Anvil, of Zenithar in Leyawiin, of Stendarr in Chorrol, of Julianos in Skingrad and of Kynareth in the wilds of the Great Forest, each with its own Archbishop (or Primate to use the offical term). But these Eight Cults were still one Faith and the Council of Eight, gathering each Primate, was established to oversee the entire Church's hierarchy. As befits the High priest of the king of the gods, the Primate of Akatosh lead the entire Cult; but this gathering happened, not in Kvatch, but in the Imperial City, by long tradition. The Temple of the One was reconsecrated to all Eight Divines and the Communion of the Saints (though the name was too entrenched to be changed despite many attempts to do so) and it was entrusted to a \"Bishop of Cyrodiil, Grand Curator of the High Imperial Temple of the Eight\", or Archbishop of the One as the laypeople always referred to them. This position, elected by the Council of Eight, was usually granted to a priest of Akatosh, sometimes of Dibella (though in the Third Era a number of priests of Talos were chosen) and served as representative of the Cult to the Imperial Court and direct liaison with the Emperor.</p> <p>The Temple's importance only grew when Reman I established the rituals of coronation and folded them with the lighting of the Dragonfires of Covenant, a religious ceremony held in the Temple. The Reman Emperors, and the Septims after them, understood the power that the Cult possessed and made it a crucial part of the spread of Imperial values (and loyalty) in the Provinces. This reached a dangerous apex when a plot, masterminded by an Archbishop of the One, an Imperial Bastard by the name Calaxes Septim, almost re-established a theocracy in Cyrodiil, after which the Church saw its powers greatly reduced. The Temple of the One played a key role in the resolution of the Oblvion Crisis, at the turn of the Third Era. These events re-ignited populat faith in Akatosh (whose cult had been steadily losing grounds to Talos's), this was reinforced by the signing of the White-Gold Covenant in 4E 175 that banned the worship of Tiber Septim. At this point the Temple of the One had become a Great Chapel of Akatosh to rival the one in Kvatch (which had been sacked by the invading Daedra) in all but name.</p> <p>During the Second Great War, large swathes of people fled to the safety of the Imperial City. Unfortunately, along with them came the Silver Plague which eagerly fell on the crowded city. While the people died in droves, the Imperial Court fled the City, leaving it into the care of the Imperial Watch, who disintegrated a scant few weeks later. When the epidemic reached its apex, corpses littered the streets, outnumbering the living five six times over, and those who had not managed to flee in time turned to the only ones willing and able to help them: the priesthood of the Temple, seemingly spared by the disease. When the plague abated, the Archbishop, Alessia Varenti, took it upon herself to restore order, until the hypothetical return of an Emperor, and recreated the Order of the Hour, a militant priestly order, to serve as a Watch and eventually a military force of the City (independently from a similar revival in Kvatch). The priests quickly took control of the lands surrounding the City itself, on the shores of Lake Rumare, as the locals were all-too-willing to accept any authority to end the lawlessness of the time. The Archdiocese, as a political entity, was born.</p> <p>In the second half of the third century, the Great Chapels renewed contact with each other and the Council of Eight was re-established, but their time apart had exacerbated the differences between the variants of the Cult. Bruma had fallen to the heathen worship of \"Neo-Ysmirism\" and severed ties with Cyrodiilic Faith altogether, Bravil now associated Mara with a host of \"Saintly Ancestors\", Skingrad's Julianites acted under the patronage of an undead monarch, Kynareth's believers had established a new Chapel in Sutch and included goblins in their ranks, Cheydinhal had enhanced ancient Arkayn traditions with Dunmeri practices and Chorrol's Chapel of Stendarr had turned itself into a fortress. But the greatest rift was between the traditionnal Akatoshic worship of Kvatch and the \"Neo-Alessianism\" of the Archdiocese. Indeed, in the wake of the Tibedetha Incident, the priests of the City started to preach that the alignment of the planets had been a demonstration of the unity of the Gods. Theological arguments for the monotheistic-beliefs of the Alessian Order were brought to light again, and a new creed started to form. The Archdiocese now professes that \"Eight is One\", the Eight Divines, merely being faces of Anu, associated with the Eight virtues, Akatosh himself, being himself associated with Nobility, was simply the highest and truest of these faces. All the other gods were once again reframed as lesser manifestations or emanations of Anu/Akatosh the One, a claim the other Primates quietly ignore.</p> <p>This religious transformation took decades to complete, but the priests of the Archdiocese believe it was vindicated when, in late 4E 300, eight Dragons chose to roost in the abandonned white Gold Tower. The Archbishop of the time, Leonara Gallio, met with the flight's leader, Shulkunaak, and reached some kind of agreement that remains secret to this day. In response, the Primate of Akatosh in Kvatch, Caecillia Medori excommunicated Gallio and anyone who followed her. Gallio answered in kind and, for the first time since the Second Era, the Council of Eight was split as a rival \"Conclave of Kvatch\" was established. this conclave was short-lived, however, as the Bosmeri coup of 335 radically altered worship of the Time Dragon in Kvatch. Nowadays, the Council of Eight still exists, with the Archbishop of the One officially representing Akatosh, but many priests of Akatosh in Colovia defer to the Primate of Auri-El in Kvatch instead.</p> <p>Cyrodiil City never fully recovered from the devastation brought about from the plague. The people are gathered along the outer walls, with each district becoming more and more empty as as one travels towards the center. Only the Temple District is fully occupied, while the Arena district is almost entirely abandonned, and reputedly haunted by the victims of the Aldmeri Dominion during the First Great war. The Elven Garden district has for the most part been converted into intra-muros farmlands. In other districts, unoccupied buildings are scavenged for stone and bricks (the City's main export) or left to whichever gang or band of goblins would lair there. The White Gold Tower and the surrounding Green Emperor Way is now the domain of Shulkunaak's flight and their mortal attendants, a group going by the name of \"Scaled Vicars\". Each district of the City and each village of the Heartlands are adminstered by a bishop, seconded by a Knight-Paladin of the Order of the Heavens (the renamed Order of the Hour).</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Argonia/","title":"Chapter. Argonia","text":"<p>Almost every river in Eastern Tamriel flows through Argonia. As the land sinks into the sea for miles upon miles of dense vegetation and murky swamps, fauna and flora unseen anywhere else on Nirn thrive. Nicknamed the \u201cgarbage heap of Tamriel\u201d, the Black Marsh is a strange and mysterious land, home to an even stranger and more mysterious folk. It is a harsh land: the air is fetid and heavy with disease, roads left unattended for mere days vanish overnight, the omnipresent vegetation makes all but the lightest of boats inoperable and many travelers simply disappear without a trace. Meanwhile, the native lizard-folfk, commonly called \u201cArgonians\u201d, or Saxhleel in their own tongue, come in a variety of forms, the deeper into the Marsh the stranger: from the \u201ccommon\u201d bipedal lizard-man to the hulking needle-toothed naga, to the toad-like paatru. These differences are attributed to the Hist, the spore-trees worshipped by Argonians and who they believe shaped their people in the beginning of Time out of mindless lizards (hence the literal meaning of Saxhleel: \u201cPeople of the Root\u201d).</p> <p>The Argonians boast of being the most ancient civilization of Tamriel, enslaving entire tribes of primitive beastfolk, erecting pyramids and performing bloody sacrifices to Sithis, the primordial Darkness, even before the Elves left the shores of Aldmeris. This gruesome empire was ruled by the Nisswo-kings, a priestly caste obsessed with appeasing their ever-ravenous god with endless sacrifices. And yet, for most of their history the Argonians have not been the masters of their lands. Indeed, in the waning days of the Early Merethic Era, a still not clearly understood combination of internal strife, ecological shifts, religious schisms and defeats at the hands of the more advanced newcomers, together known as \u201cthe Duskfall\u201d, spelled the doom of this proto-Empire of the East.</p> <p>The Argonians scattered into numerous, often hostile, tribes and abandoned the notion of civilization, instead embracing impermanence, thus their traditional architecture and tools are all made to be discarded and destroyed by the relentless corrosive power of the Marsh, while the older xanmeer ziggurats were left to sink under the waters. Even their understanding of Sithis changed, from an embodiment of inescapable death and destruction to the herald of change and rebirth. Which is not to say that no civilization existed in Argonia in the Late Merethic and First Eras, but rather that it was others who took up the burden of taming the land. In the West, the Barsaebic Ayleids, fleeing religious persecution in Cyrodiil, founded the cities of Silyanorn and Twyllbek (modern-day Stormhold and Gideon). The Cantemiric Velothi, splinters of the Chimeri Exodus, built Archon and Thorn on the East coast. The South was home to a nomadic fox-people, the Lilmothiit, whose temporary settlements evolved into the cities of Lilmoth, Blackrose and Soulrest. Finally, human tribes from both Tamriel and Akavir settled the area, such as the Kothringi, the Yespest, the Orma and the Horwalli. Tragically these many people did not share the Argonians\u2019 fabled resistance to diseases and the Thrassian Plague and Khnahaten Flu wiped out these ancient cultures leaving us only their ancient cities to know them by.</p> <p>For centuries, Argonia\u2019s political fracture and inhospitable environment have made it a prime target for slave-raids and a haven for pirates of all stripes. It wasn\u2019t until the eleventh century of the First Era that Hestra, the warrior-Empress, brought some semblance of order to the region after her defeat of the infamous pirate \u201cking\u201d Red Bramman. But it was Reman the Second who brought Black Marsh into the Imperial fold in 1E 2837 after twenty-six years of war, consolidating its northern and Eastern territories into an Imperial Province. This feat would only be surpassed by Tiber Septim\u2019s conquest of all of Argonia\u2019s surrounding coastline, with the hellish Inner Marsh remaining the Great Emperor\u2019s sole undefeated foe.^(1)</p> <p>All Imperial efforts to tame the land and bring modern agricultural and industrial techniques to the natives remained fruitless outside of the border cities. Yet, when the Oblivion Crisis came, Black Marsh fared much better than other Provinces. Military historians are unanimous in attributing that success to the environment, as deadly to Dagonite Cultists and dremora as it was to Imperial Legionnaries, and the Province\u2019s low importance in the schemes of the Daedra. Yet the An-Xileel, a group of fanatics operating out of the city of Helstrom, deep in the least accessible parts of the Marsh, convinced the populace they were their saviors and lead an uprising against the Empire, forming the modern Kingdom of Argonia. They then took advantage of the Dunmer\u2019s weakness following the Red Year by launching a full invasion of Morrowind, known as the Accession War, in revenge for millennia of slave raids. Under the xenophobic heel of the An-Xileel, the campaign was of an unprecedented brutality^(2) and entire defenseless populations were put to the sword. The Argonian eventually retreated to Black Marsh without a real battle, when the House Redoran, who had been spared the worst of the Red Year, started to organize a defense.</p> <p>The An-Xileel bloodlust did not stop there, however. While the true events of the \u201cUmbriel Crisis\u201d of 4E 42 remain unclear, it has been firmly established that the An-Xileel took advantage of the Floating City\u2019s apparition to carry out an ethnic cleansing of their lands, slaughtering non-Argonians and Lukiul (\u201cImperialized\u201d) Argonians alike. This eventually prompted a revolt against their tyranny and a more moderate government was put in place.</p> <p>The Argonians\u2019 famed resistance to disease served them well during the Silver Plague and their Kingdom was the one polity who not only did not crumble but instead thrived from the catastrophe (resurrecting some of the old libel that blamed the Khnahaten Flu on the Argonians).^(3) Indeed, the Kingdom expanded North and East annexing large swathes of southern Resdayn and the Niben Valley. However, while their attention was directed elsewhere, Sload migrants took over their southernmost city, Lilmoth through necromancy and deception and have renamed it \"New Thras\". Since then, the Kingdom has been stuck in a three-way struggle with the Potentate and Resdayn over influence and control of Eastern Tamriel while cautiously watching the Sloads\u2019 next move.</p> <p>Politically, the Kingdom of Argonia is a confederation of tribes living in the Black Marsh, and each ranging from a few dozens to a few thousand members; as well as the great foreign-built cities of the borders and the villages that dot the conquered lands. While maps often show the Black Marsh as entirely within the control of the Kingdom, many tribes have not federated with it, especially in the Southern and Eastern regions. Each tribe is ruled by a chieftain whose power is subject to popular approval, usually advised by a Tree-minder although the positions are often merged as well. Tree-minders are one of the two main priestly orders of the Argonians. As the name implies, they are tasked with taking care of the tribe\u2019s Hist tree and to interpret the visions they allegedly receive from them. The cities are ruled by hereditary Saxhlords, in the manner of Cyrodiilic counts, while smaller communities use varying modes of governance, often electing a mayor or a town\u2019s council every few years, although hereditary rule is not unfrequent. Each of these different groups sends representatives to the \u201cMarsh councils\u201d, local assemblies that gather regularly in the cities and whenever an issue between tribes arises in the Marsh. Citizenry is divided into two classes: first there are the Saxhleel, the Argonians themselves, and below them the Beekojel, \u201cFriendly outsiders\u201d, mostly from the Niben and Arnesia and who have many rights denied to them: their communities are not allowed representation in the Marsh Councils, they are not allowed to gather in public, to practice certain professions or to own land and they pay higher taxes.^(4)</p> <p>A \u201cGreat Council of the Marsh\u201d serves as the government of the Kingdom. Envoys from a majority of tribes, villages and cities (though never all of them, for practical reasons) pass laws and entrusts certain individuals with specific missions (such as generalship over an army in order to defend a given region). The Grand Council is presided over by the King of Argonia, who by tradition takes the name of Histwo, Speaks-for-the-Hist. The title of King (or Queen) of Argonia is an inadequate translation, as the King does not have any power over the Grand Council\u2019s decisions. While his opinion holds a great weight, as he allegedly speaks the will of the Hist themselves, his role is to manage the debate and cast a tie-breaking vote. He does, however, have the power to decide where and when the Grand Council gathers, essentially deciding who will be in attendance.^(5) Furthermore, the King does not rule for life nor is the position hereditary. Indeed, it seems that the only requirement is to be an Argonian from the deep marsh and, in the course of the Kingdom\u2019s history, a number of decrepit old people, children and even on one occasion, an egg^(6), were picked to be King. The selection process, as well as the way the length of the \u201cterm\u201d is decided, is kept secret but is known to involve a gathering of Helstrom\u2019s tree-minders, the advice of the precedent King, the lengendary \"Eye of Argonia\", and an assembly of the most respected Nisswo. Finally, the King is known to commend the loyalty of the Shadowscales, an order of assassin-priests with historic ties to the infamous Dark Brotherhood who work to silence those who would oppose his decrees, usually lethally.</p> <p>Nisswoism, which is to say a religion focused on the worship of the Primordial Principle Sithis, but lacking scripture, an organized clergy or even an established creed, is the main cult of the Black Marsh. The Nisswo, or \u201cNothing-Speakers\u201d, are nomadic priests, travelling from village to city to village, each preaching their own interpretation of Sithis and the proper way to honor it. They hold considerable influence over the Argonians\u2019 minds, but their own order, the Clutch of Nisswo, reflects the division of the people. There are three movements within the cult: the Swamp, Blood and Stone Nisswo. These are only informal names as they describe loose sets of beliefs rather than political organizations and many Argonians do not strictly adhere to either.</p> <p>The Swamp Nisswo are the orthodoxy and still the largest group. They revere Sithis as the Changer, who gives and takes in equal measure. They preach impermanence in all things and isolationism for Argonia. Despite being the largest grouping of Nisswo, they are not as influential on the Kingdom's politics as the other two because a lot of their followers belong to tribes who didn't join it. The Blood Nisswo wish to bring Argonia back to the time of the Nisswo-Kings and worship Sithis as the Destroyer, who must be appeased with frequent rituals and sacrifices. They preach the importance of struggle and an aggressive foreign policy especially where Resdayn and the Potentate are concerned. Finally, the Stone Nisswo, who revere Sithis as the Hatcher who brings forth new ways and ideas, are modernists. They preach the acceptance of foreign customs (like cities and modern engineering) and a relaxed approach to foreign policy. They are most popular among the Lukiuls and the Beekojels.</p> <p>There are eight major cities in Argonia.</p> <p>Stormhold, in the North-West, produces much of the Province\u2019s mineral wealth which is then transported to the rest of the kingdom via waterways. The city\u2019s second claim to fame is the Kingdom\u2019s premier magical institute: Tohthux-Tzel, \u201cThe Place of Secret Snakes\u201d, housed within a xanmeer that is said to change locations^(7), sometimes \"visiting\" another city entirely. The Tohthuxleel focus on studying shadowmagic as well as so-called \u201cHist magic\u201d, but they are also known to organize large archeological expeditions into both Elven and Argonian ruins seeking to master the ancient powers of the past.</p> <p>Thorn and Tear in the North-East are collectively known as the \u201cJewels of the East\u201d, sitting on opposite sides of a bay, both cities have traded with each other for as long as they have existed, despite their conflictual relationship. Indeed, Tear used to be the capital of the slave-drivers of House Dres, who often seized control of Thorn to ensure the flow of fresh bodies to their plantations. Nowadays, Thorn serves as headquarters to Argonia\u2019s navy while Tear as become a fortress city, constantly engaged in skirmishes with raiders from Resdayn. Tear\u2019s infamous slave market, the largest and most bloody of its kind in all of Tamriel\u2019s history, was razed during the Accession War. Today stands in its place a colossal statue of an Argonian warrior, clad in the armor of the An-Xileel, stomping the face of a Dunmeri noble.</p> <p>Gideon, the westernmost city of the kingdom, is also the most modern, as almost all of its population embraced imperial values. Uniquely the Saxhlords of the city, are not\u00a0Argonians, but Nibeneans who took arms against the Empire in the Early Fourth Era. They claim descent from the Kothringi and seek to emulate that ancient culture, most prominently by wearing slivery body-paint and feathered hats. As part of that \u201ckothringi revival\u201d the city sponsors large temples dedicated to Dibella and Zenithar (or Z\u2019en). Indeed, the ancient Trade-Abbey of Zenithar within the Blackwood is protected by Gideon and is one of the Tamrielic Bank of Z\u2019en\u2019s largest trade centers in the South.</p> <p>Helstrom, the seat of the King of Argonia, lies in the center of Middle Argonia, according to the Geographical Society\u2019s best estimates. Not only is the city forbidden to outsiders, the swamp itself makes it practically impossible for any non-Argonian to enter it, as the very air carries deadly diseases. Legends abound of Argonian of even stranger shape than those already attested (six-limbed, gigantic or looking like grey-skinned humans). The most reliable account of the city at our disposal is the diary of Luciannus Tenns, Ambassador of the Thonican Regency to Black Marsh.^(8)</p> <p>Archon, situated on the Eastern coast, Archon is the least populated of the Marsh\u2019s cities, subsisting mostly on fishing and the coming and going of trading vessels along the Eastern route. However, in recent years Archon has served as the launching point of a number of Argonian expeditions into the Padomaic Ocean. Despite Potentate experts certifying that the Argonian ships are incapable of reaching the first of the Padomaic Isles, the kingdom has deliberately allowed rumors of trade with Akavir to spread.^(9) Archon\u2019s main point of interest is the Shadowscale Citadel, the headquarters and training facility of the King\u2019s thugs. Situated in an ancient Cantemiric temple to Mephala, the Forstress is topped by a gruesome statue of the Daedra of murder sinisterly overlooking the city.</p> <p>Soulrest was once the Imperial capital of the Province. Thanks to its position on the Eastern Bank of the Topal Bay, it is a bustling trade-port, and home to the greatest shipyards of the South (threatened only by the rapidly developing Port Katariah). Unfortunately for the locals, this wealth has attracted more and more attention from the Baandari pirates, which have begun establishing secret harbors in the Marsh. Soulrest is also famous for being the religious center of the Brotherhood of Sethiete, a cult mixing elements of Nedic Lorkhan-worship with Nisswoism.</p> <p>Blackrose\u2019s main source of income are its salt marshes, a crucial necessity in the warm climes of the south. But it is most well-known for the infamous Blackrose Fortress. Originally built as a prison by the Empire, this tower now serves as the Kingdom\u2019s bulwark against their southern neighbors, the Sload of New Thras. Unlike the rest of Argonia, the city and the surrounding areas are ruled by military officers, with almost no civilian authority. While the brutish Nagas, native to Murkmire where the city lays, make up most of its military, they are joined by volunteers from all over the nation.</p> <p>1. Of course, no mention of Hestra's defeat against Indoril during the War for Silyanorn or how Reman's conquest involved \"the Great Burn\" which set the western half of Black Marsh on fire for three long years.</p> <p>2. Bah, like the Tiber Wars were all smiles and candies. The Argonians' brutality in the War of Accession was, unfortunately, not unique in the history of Tamriel.</p> <p>3. At least, the Guide admits that it is libel. Can't say that of all the \"reputable publications\" these days.</p> <p>4. Painting with too wide a brush, the rights of the beekojels vary from case to case. Generally speaking the humans in the West are treated much better than the Dunmer in the North, and there are \"historical beekojels\" whose families sided with the Kingdom against the Empire, or are otherwise so assimiliated into the province that they are treated pretty much as equals with the Saxhleel, legally speaking, they usually call themselves \"Argonians\" too.</p> <p>5. There seems to be a number of limitations on the King's power to decide that, actually. I don't know what the law is, but as far as I understand from talking about it with a few dockworkers from Archon, it seems to ensure every region is consulted about as often as the others.</p> <p>6. Right, the egg-king allegedly ruled through an interpreter who translated the pecks he made against the inside of his shell into decree. I think we can all take a pretty good guess as to who was actually in charge, though.</p> <p>7. Read: there are no consistent paths within the Marsh.</p> <p>8. Ridiculous! By his own account Tenns spent his entire stay there wracked by fever and spent the rest of his life moving from one mental institution to the next. This is what passes for reliable scholarship, but my contributions are refused!? What next, one of those \"authentic\" journals of the Eternal Champion perhaps? The truth is that we don't know what Helstrom looks like, it could be a single xanmeer or a classic Argonian village or perhaps even just a sacred clearing where the priests meet.</p> <p>9. I have a hard time believing the Argonians established a relationship with the Akaviri as well. But it's absurd to deny they have reached at least Yneslea, perhaps even Esroniet. Their shipyards have had access to captured Imperial oceanic ships for a long time and there's no other way to explain the flood of Tsaesci artifacts I've seen in Archon.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Baandari%20Coast/","title":"Chapter. Baandari Coast","text":"<p>The Southern Sea, sometimes called the Serpentwild by its inhabitants, is proximal to the sugar-rich Tenmar Forest, contains the bellicose nations of Pyandonea, and has long been a major shipping route for all the major powers of Tamriel. Therefore it has always attracted smuggler bands, thieves guilds, and wharf rats of every sort. The region has become the \u201cBaandari Coast,\u201d also \u201cBaan Dar\u2019s Coast,\u201d the \u201cBaandari Wilds\u201d, and \u201cBandithome\u201d(1), names often applied due to the preponderance of crime and lack of a single centralized authority to deal with them. Rather, various islands and city-states cling to independence despite the growing lawlessness around them.</p> <p>The problem truly became endemic in the second century of the Current Era, however, when the Aldmeri Dominion began funding and training native Khajiit and Bosmeri pirate crews in order to reorganize them into semi-autonomous privateer fleets that could harass the Mede Empire\u2019s southern shipping and supply lines without directly implicating the Dominion government. It is now known that certain Thalmor officers even offered special \u201cmarks of bounty\u201d on significant Imperial ships. While an admittedly clever if devious strategy for the Thalmor, it had devastating long-lasting implications for the region. In privatizing their war on Imperial shipping, the Dominion had created floating schools of crime.</p> <p>The piratical economy escalated greatly out of Dominion control in the collapse of governmental authority that ensued following the Second Great War. The Silver Plague performed best in humid environments, and so the tropical coastlines suffered first. Common citizens and public officials alike died feverish and vomiting in cramped metropolises. Many nobles outright fled to the countryside, leaving their people to fend for themselves. Plantation owners and rural nobility would become the real powers of the region in the years to come, establishing themselves as the principal powers of the new Baandari Coast through alliance with the corsairs.</p> <p>In short time, the corsairs took advantage of the mounting crisis to seize control of ports along not only the Southern Sea, but also the western Niben, and all across the Abecean. They formed alliances with invading Maormeri clans from Pyandonea, established ties with unscrupulous magistrates, and bullied naive locals with fear and intimidation. Certainly, raiding treasure ships to prevent the establishment of proper commerce and banking has worked well in their favor, forcing those under their sway to accept systems of barter in which moon sugar and wine had (and in some regions still have) become the closest equivalents to currency. Even in those places where coinage has resumed, the corsairs\u2019 ill-gotten gains seem to be the main source by which said currency enters the market.\u00a0</p> <p>The winds shifted in the 240s as fewer cases of the Silver Plague began to be reported, and proper governments began to organize and reassert themselves against these corsairs and their craven allies. The Battle of Port Dibellum, in which the nascent Freehold navy routed a larger corsair fleet, caused quite the panic in the criminal underworld. Some went underground, while others realized the necessity of banding together all the more if they were to weather the storm. These commodores began speaking of common piracy as if it was a matter of patriotism and religious liberty.</p> <p>Next was the Blockade of Greenheart in 261. The Freehold Republic attempted once more to push out the pirate-sympathetic regime, but this time was foiled when the local Bosmer decided they preferred their criminal overlords to merchant-aristocracy from Auridon. A rather unique agreement was eventually reached (see below), and as a result the city has been something of a halfway point between the lawless wilds of Bloodtoil and Baandari, and the civilized mercantilism of the Freehold Republic.</p> <p>With their western territories shrinking, the pirates grew ever more desperate to reassert their dominance. At this time a notorious outlaw, Commodore Ra\u2019Fajjan the \u201cExtended Claw of Baan Dar\u201d entered the scene. In the late 290s and early 300s, she became the most fierce advocate and executioner of \u201crazzias\u201d, raids upon various coastlines to seize territory, take galley slaves, and instill fear in regional authorities.(2) Even though she was quite advanced in age by that point, she is also most likely responsible for organizing the \u201cGreat Razzia\u201d of 337 which devastated so much of our fair Nibenay, though our armed forces would ensure it was her last raid. With a little aid from our Anequinan friends, all the pirate outposts were repelled and much of the damage was repaired. Our fruitful employment of the Dragons of Niben has safely prevented further incursions. The full extent of Baandari influence, therefore, has been safely contained to Baan Dar\u2019s Coast.</p> <p>Today, the Baandari Coast remains a cauldron of crime and dysfunction. The common god of the region is, naturally, Baan Dar and the so-called \u201cCode of Baan Dar\u201d is the closest thing to a united law and religious creed among the corsairs of the Serpentwild. What we know of the Code, and the inner workings of the pirates in general, comes to us from the writings of Vinnus Randas,(3) who spent a number of years on the Baandari Coast being traded from galley to galley. According to his harrowing tale:</p> <p>\u201c...the Baan Dar Code dictates that a pirate may take anything which is not properly guarded against. Among the Peddlars, this means valuables which are left in the open are considered \u201cproper salvage,\u201d as is any good found in an unlocked container. But the crooked corsair crews take this even further, suggesting that anything which a person did not put up a decent fight to protect is worthy salvage in the eyes of their Bandit God. Under the code, each ship is ruled by a mob, and the captain and the mob must live in a constant game of competition and fear with one another for power. One wrong move and a captain may lose their head. For this reason their \u201cCode\u201d also generally forbids an armory on the ship, and each sailor is compelled on pain of punishment to keep their own saber, crossbow, and claws polished and battle-ready. Most of all the Code calls for \u201cfair\u201d trade and dealings among the crew, requiring each ship to set its own rules regarding the distribution of \u201csalvage\u201d and the election of quartermasters. When conflict does arise, as it does frequently, it is dealt with most nastily and brutishly, but swiftly. Such is Baan Dar\u2019s \u201cjustice\u201d among the pirates.\u201d(4)</p> <p>That is not to say Baan Dar is the only divinity worshiped in the Coast. This region of Tamriel has always been diverse, and the interests of trade have increased that diversity. Khajiit and Bosmer make up the majority of the populace and the corsairs, and practice their traditional pantheons, but also among them are enigmatic Maormeri who revere Mother Sea, Altmer fulfilling Phynaster\u2019s call to travel (many of whom are veterans of the Great Wars), godless Sload outlaws, wandering Redguard sword-cultists, Colovian adventurers who follow Kynareth\u2019s winds, and foolish profit-seekers from every possible culture and heritage who have brought their religion with them.</p> <p>The overall political situation of the Baandari Coast is complex. Returning again to the words of Vinnus Randas, \u201cthe Coast is in reality an elaborate conspiracy-web cast perhaps by Saint Mephala. The cities depend on trade and piracy, especially insofar as their independence is concerned. The rural countryside relies on internal commerce and trade with the Baandari Peddlers and plantation clans, who I believe are likely in alliance with the corsairs. \u201cFollow the sugar,\u201d they say down here. The clan elders don\u2019t want to share their sugar with the Manes. The cities don\u2019t want to pay taxes to foreign militias. Better to rely on these pirates for their so-called \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201cprosperity\u201d. It is like the security rackets of the lowly street thug, much to the immiseration of the commonfolk and the foreign merchants alike.\u201d</p> <p>Places of Note:</p> <p>The \u201cGold Cat City\u201d of Senchal on the easternmost reaches of this thuggish domain is the most prominent in politics, economics, and corruption. Its many wine houses, gambling houses, and skooma dens render it a popular resort town for sailors in the South looking to forget their money on a night of cheap thrills. The city\u2019s sole ruler is the \u201cHarbor-Duke\u201d Dro\u2019Zhan, an heir to the legacy of Ra\u2019Fajjan, who nursed all rebellion for forty years. Though he has yet to confess it publicly, it is alleged by Argonia that Dro\u2019Zhan is also the \u201cCorsair-King\u201d who has been organizing the Baandari fleets in razzias on Argonian territory. The natives of Senchal suffer in destitution and addiction as their avaricious lord and his decadent coterie of backers continue his zealous campaigns against all law and order.</p> <p>In recent years, attempts have been made by regional governments to bring the city in line. The failed coups of Pelletine, Argonia, and, yes, our own nightblades have drawn ire and criticism from local Khajiiti clans. The power of the skooma lobby in the city, it seems, is far too much to easily surmount, with many natives bafflingly enamored with their overlords.(5) Senchal has many great sugar refineries, and is the beginning of the \u201cRi\u2019saad Line,\u201d a trade route that extends all the way to Whiterun in the North. The masters of the Senchal refineries, the local clan mothers, are paid allies to the Harbor-Duke, and command loyalty throughout the southern peninsula.</p> <p>If Senchal is the Baandari Coast\u2019s economic capital, Mistral, located on the northern shores of Khenarthia, is its spiritual soul. The \u201cSpeaker for the Moons and Sky\u201d lives in a temple at the top of the Roost - a great mountain which has at times lent its name to the entire island. The rest of the city spirals around the great mountain, with other shrines, estates, and government buildings located near the top, until one reaches the market docks at the bottom. More ancient temples to the different aspects of the Moons can be found across the island, attracting spiritual seekers and history-minded academics alike. Unfortunately, the local Speaker\u2019s distance from the affairs of the common folk has allowed the corrupt port officials(6) to welcome the Baandari corsairs and happily let them restock and maintain their ships in exchange for suspiciously low prices on a variety of goods, as seems to be policy in many port cities and villages across Bandithome.</p> <p>The island isn\u2019t all religious sites, however. Khenarthia has many plantations which produce sugar and exotic fruits, and a few kwama egg colonies on the western side. The southern side of the isle, Eagle\u2019s Bane, is settled by a clan of Maormer who have built a coraltown and taken to ray-farming. The Maormer and Mistral have long had a strange back-and-forth relationship throughout history, but in recent years seem to have reached an accord. Certainly the Maormeri weather-magic is quite useful in maintaining the island\u2019s independence, rumors of the clan\u2019s ties to the Baandari fleets notwithstanding.\u00a0</p> <p>The Long Coast peninsula in the center of the region was settled by Altmer and later Khajiit colonists, who cut trees, planted fields, and built cities. Thus it has been able to boast of having some of the most multicultural populations on the Southern Sea. Haven can be found on the east end of this peninsula, which came under the protection of a military order called the Red Spears during the Silver Plague. This band makes claims of liberty and meritocracy, welcoming members of all walks of life so long as they can fight, and being ruled by a Jihatt K\u2019hari (meaning, roughly, \u201ckingly mercenary\u201d), who is in theory elected from their ranks. In fact, a cadre of wealthy senior warriors, mostly Khajiit, Altmer and a few Bosmer, serve as the true inner circle which governs the Red Spears\u2019 decision making and leadership.</p> <p>Southpoint on the west end of the Long Coast peninsula has styled itself a \u201cFree Republic\u201d, ruled in theory by a council of landed nobles and concerned intellectuals. The true masters of the city are, critics argue, the corsairs who openly dock at the port and drink to their hearts\u2019 content. The city-state thrives on the coins brought in from the treasure ships the corsairs love to raid, making it the prime example of the Baandari system of subversion. Half the city remains the domain of these foreign ruffians, as the other native half attempts to bring order and civility through the soul industry and greater scholasticism.(7) Tensions are high, and riots and drunken violence are all-too common in the sad, squalor-filled metropolis that was once the Cyrodiilic jewel of the Grahtwood.</p> <p>The Free City of the Elden Wood, Greenheart, is a nominal member of the Freehold Republic. It is also a sacred city to the Wilder Court of the Greenshade Bosmer. As noted earlier, the city\u2019s entry into the Republic involved a lengthy naval blockade which was ultimately ended when the local treethanes and Green-speakers were granted spiritual and political autonomy over the city and its surrounding environs in exchange for certain economic concessions to the Republic. The anarchic nature of Greenshade civilization has thus allowed smugglers and sea-bandits to make the surrounding shores their home, a situation the treethanes are all too happy to exploit if it helps maintain their independence.\u00a0</p> <p>Current Events:</p> <p>When Councilor Fabius Andronicus(8) stated a decade ago (at the time of publication) that he believed a united pirate republic could be forming in the Southern Sea, which could threaten all peace loving citizens of the Niben, he received audible laughs from his audience. While it is certainly true that the corsairs thus far are rather decentralized, it cannot be denied that the Baandari are making great inroads in many regions and cities of Tamriel. One need look no further than our own city of Water\u2019s Edge, where authorities have recently arrested a magistrate for conspiring with smugglers connected to the Baandari. Other cities are not as thorough as Nibenean justice: there is rumored corruption at the docks of Dusk, Soulrest, and even the mysterious New Thras. Argonia is especially vulnerable to the rise of the Baandari corsairs: it is said that for every secret harbor the Argonians stamp out, another three take its place.</p> <p>There has been mixed success in efforts to root out the piratical menace on the all-important Southern Sea. The Freehold Republic has stepped up raids and patrols, but their inefficient decentralized style of government prevents them from truly eradicating their enemies. Pa\u2019alatiine has also attempted to reassert control, especially where its southern port cities are concerned, but the deep-seated religious divisions among the Khajiiti clans proves an obstacle to such plans. Many Bosmer clans from the Bloodtoil Pack are outright complicit, and mock the idea of shipping laws if they acknowledge them at all.</p> <p>The New Model Navy, however, has made much more successful strides against the corsairs, such as the recent raid which brought to justice the notorious Maormeri Commodore Vashin the Outlaw. Our forces are expected to make further successful captures in the near future, with vital aid from our friends in the East Empire Company of course. Let us hope and pray for their success, and that Councilor Andronicus\u2019 prediction not become a reality.9</p> <p>\u2014-</p> <p>1I\u2019ve been all over the Southern Sea, and I\u2019ve never heard anyone call it \u201cBandithome.\u201d</p> <p>2Stupid propaganda and exaggeration. Khajiit don\u2019t even take slaves, they suffered enough of it at the hands of the Dunmer House-lords in ages past.</p> <p>3Ah, the old tale of \u201cVinnus Randas\u201d was first printed as \u201cI Was A Corsair\u2019s Prisoner\u201d in the old gossip rag The Cyrod Inquiry, which printed other \u201crespectable\u201d stories such as \u201cIs Councilor Olwyn A Freehold Spy?\u201d and \u201cA Guar Ate My Baby!\u201d. Can\u2019t believe they put that garbage in here. Or maybe I can.</p> <p>4From what I understand, and I\u2019m sadly an outsider, there are Baan Dar \u201ccodes,\u201d not a single code. It varies from ship to ship and fleet to fleet. And usually sounds much more fair than any Company vessel, that\u2019s for damned sure.</p> <p>5That\u2019s right, the people must all be too deep in the sugar to notice a pirate\u2019s in charge of their city. Guarshit. It\u2019s a pleasure city alright, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as they say.</p> <p>6The so-called \u201ccorrupt\u201d officials know what they\u2019re doing, and have the Speaker\u2019s full approval. The corsairs are local heroes to the people of Mistral.</p> <p>7Hmm. Clever attempt there, Geographical Society. Make it sound like the Baandari in Southpoint are all foreigners and the locals want them gone. Doubt if anyone will fall for it.</p> <p>8That senile old loudmouth Andronicus also said King Orgnum was the one organizing this pirate republic to destroy trade in the South, from what I recall. Which is nonsense, because the Maormer in the Baandari fleets are all belonging to those \u201cbreakaway clans\u201d from what I understand, that owe no loyalty to their lich-king or whatever he is. Anyway, most corsair fleets outside Senchal only organize for a short time for a specific goal. There\u2019s not a lick of proof they want to be a united republic.</p> <p>9Potentate\u2019s Guide to the Environs, or Propaganda Given by Edict?</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Colovian%20Frontier/","title":"Chapter. Colovian Frontier","text":"<p>Colovia long been a vital component of the Empire, its mineral riches and hardy people, ideally suited to serve in the Legions, complementing the Niben's vast agricultural output and advanced wizardry. This is for these very reasons that, during the Second Great War, the Aldmeri focused their initial assault on the region. But the devastation brought on by the fierce fighting would pale in comparison to the ravages brought on by the Silver Plague, often carried there from far-off lands by unsuspecting human Legionnaire or Elven soldiers. As a result the region suffered the highest death toll of the epidemic, with estimates ranging from three fourths to five sixths of the population dying. Ghastly tales abound of cohorts coming to the defense of specific settlements only to find them inhabited only by corpses showing the infamous pale sheen that gave the disease its name. In order to survive, the people fled towns and cities to the relative isolation of the countryside. While some gathered to the ancient Wayshrines of the Divines whose blessings seem to offer some amount of protection (in particular those dedicated to Arkay near Skingrad and Kvatch), most turned to banditry with a crueltry born of desperation. This period of lawlessness, colloquially known as \"The Days of the Lean Wolves\", crippled any attempt at centralized governments and even today, almost two hundred years later, the Colovian city-states can only reliably control their close surroundings.</p> <p>The largest and most powerful city of Colovia is Chorrol. Of all the kingdoms of the region it is the one who has changed the least from the days of the Empire. Indeed, Chorrol fancies herself the leader of reborn \"Colovian Estates\" and a rival of Cheydinhal for the legacy of the Empire of Cyrodiil, to the point that her monarchs have eschewed the title of king in favor of that of Archduke of Colovia. The greatest pride of the Chorrolinas is the Great Chapel of Stendarr, which has been continously expanded in size to serve as fortress to the Knightly Order of the Crusaders of Stendarr, which has swelled to numbers not seen since the Interregnum of the Second Era. More academically-minded visitors will no doubt seek the College of Whispers, seated in the Great Oak Plaza and whose advances in enchanting, though religiously controversial, have done wonders for the economy of the city, which relies mainly on lumber, tin and copper.</p> <p>The second most powerful city in the region, and Chorrol's main rival, is Skingrad, the City of Julianos. During the First Great War, the city's count was revealed by the invading Elves to have been an undying vampire, Janus Hassildor, who had ruled the county continously since the late Third Era through intermediaries and passing himself as his own descendants. While he was saved in extremis from death by sunlight exposure in public by faithful servants, the visible toll the punishment had taken on him had made his nature undeniable and following the White-Gold Concordate, Titus II saw fit to name General Jonna Countess of Skingrad, as reward for her service during the Great War. Unfortunately for the people of the City, their new Nordic Countess was a soldier through and through and her main concern was preparing for the coming second conflict with the Dominion, all other matters be damned, and she became widely unpopular. Nonetheless, when the city found herself to be among the first urban center hit by the Silver Plague just as an Aldmeri army marched on, Conutess Jonna recognized the impossibility of holding under siege and ordered the entire city to be evacuated while she lead her troops into a sacrificial charge against the Elves. It is perhaps then unsurprising that when Janus Hassildor made himself known again, his former subjects flocked to the one who they associated with their former Golden age. King Janus now openly rules the City as a vampire, a condition shared by several of his courtiers, though he insists that they only feed on those criminals sentenced to death and willing donors (indeed it is rumored to be a way of quick advancement within the Vampire King's court). Despite the best efforts of \"the wine capital of Cyrodiil\", this state of affair casts a gloomy image on the city, something not helped by the persistent rumors that the ghosts of the Elven army, who allegedly all died of the plague less than a day after taking the city, haunt the streets at night.</p> <p>While her leadership has traditionally belogned to the Crown party of Redguards, descended from the Totambu aristocracy of Yokuda, the  common people of Elinhir have always mingled with their Cyrodiilic neighbors to the East and adopted many trappings of their culture, to the point the city is now considered a part of Colovia rather than Hammerfell by her people, something that the Yokedate to the South-West objects to in the strongest possible way. As such, it is perhaps unsuprising that when the city's nobility fell victim to the plague, the Elinhirri turned to the Blackcasters, the ancient order of wizards who gave the \"City of Mages\" its epithet. While their remedies where only mildly effective in combatting the Plague, their potent destruction magic proved invaluable in defending the city against its various enemies. As a result the Elinhirri are now ruled by a concil of six Archmagisters, each specializing in one of the Schools of Magic, who serve for life (after which their surviving colleagues pick their replacement from the order's most talented wizards). Should the council be tied, a, elected representative of the common people, the Speaker, whose role is otherwise purely advisory, is allowed a deciding vote.</p> <p>During the Interwar Period, the ancient city of Sutch, which had become nothing more than a ruin occupied by bandits was re-fortified to defend against and invasion from Valenwood. The old Great Chapel of Kynareth was rebuilt and commoners moved from the Highlands to support the Garrison. While it was undeniably fought over fiercely, it is unknown which side (if any) came on top as the belligerants were decimated byt the plague and all corpses found inside were burned by the town's new masters. Indeed when the Plague had abated and people moved to re-settle the city, they found it already inhabited, by goblins. Several tribes had come under the leadership of a particularly cunning warlord and taken the fortress as their own. As the humans prepared to make war, to free their homeland, the Primate of Kynareth, Andreas Jarrol, brokered a peaceful solution to the conflict, allowing humans and goblin-ken to co-exist as he spread the the teachings of Kynareth to the primitives, today the city is still lead by Goddess' Primate. Sutch remains the smallest of city states of Colovia, but it profits immensely from trade with nearby Anvil and the Freehold Republic.</p> <p>Kvatch was long a successful example of a city re-ermerging from the Days of the Lean Wolves as the ruling monarchs took advantage of Bsomeri refugees fleeing the chaos of Valenwood to bolster their economy and even found satellite cities. Unfortunately a fringe movement of Ayleid Revivalists successfully overthrew them and created a \"New Ayleid Imperium\" which spread over Valenwood, leaving the city a client state of Silvenar. Furthermore the Chantry of Akatosh was made to incorporate ever more elements of Almderi/Ayleid religion, now even referring to the Time God as Auri-El and open worship of the Daedric Prince Meridia. Despite this state of affair, many Kvatchians have kept ties with Colovia and a small but growing Akatoshic movement gathers regularly at the Wayshrine of Akatosh near the City.</p> <p>The final city of note to mention is Sancre Tor, the Craddle of Empires. The Golden Hill had been abandonned and considred cursed since the days of Tiber Septim but in 4E 266, the many minotaur tribes of Cyrodiil congregated towards Sancre Tor, at the behest of the Cow-Queen Ahrzum, who had received a vision of her distant ancestor Morihaus, and proceeeded to rebuild the city with amazing speed. This was initially witnessed with worry by the neigbouring towns and the city of Chorrol in particular who clashed several times with the Manbeasts as they foraged for supplies. But in 4E 320, the largest nomad horde yet seen moved through the region, and both cities allied together to repel them, this alliance was followed by a trade deal, and soon enough the Kingdom of Sancre Tor became a recognized polity of Cyrodiil. It has even become a major pilgrimage site as people come to pray on the spots where Alessia, Reman and Tiber were granted the Amulet of Kings. The Minotaurs have allowed this although they keep their own religion, whose major figures are the Heavenly Bull, Morihaus, his mother the Storm, his wife Alessia and her father Shezarr.</p> <p>As explained above, these cities only control a fraction of the region and many villages and small towns are de facto independent, while large stretches of lands remain unclaimed, their mineral and agricultural wealths dormant. However this sorry state of affairs is soon to be a thing of the past as the East Empire Company has vastly invested in the revalorisation of the region by re-establishing ancient roads (made secure by Company security forces trained by Legion veterans), connecting isolated villages, and sponsoring indepedent settlers. Colovia shall soon enough once more be a beacon of civilization for the rest of Tamriel!</p> <p>Yzmul gra-Maluk: by \"connecting villages\" and \"sponsoring settlers\" they mean using predatory loans to trap them in debt and use them as cheap labor, at least until they can get undead to do it for even less. They are entire tracks of lands where the EEC might as well be the government. Makes sense, the Potentate's got some restrictions about how bad you can treat your people and that's already too much for the EEC fatcats. Also, most people I've talked to in Kvatch don't seem to mind having Bosmer, sorry Ayleid, rulers instead of humans. And the goblins of Sutch are on equal footing with the Colovians there, hell, it's their connection with the goblins of the Freehold that made trade possible.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Druadach%20Kingdom/","title":"Chapter. Druadach Kingdom","text":"<p>The people of the Reach are as divided as their land of hills, crags and serpentine rivers. Indeed, the very question of whether the Reachfolk are their own race, a unique strain of Bretons with a particularly mixed ancestry or a cultural grouping of Nords, Bretons, Redguards, Cyrodiils, Elves and even Orcs, still divides ethnographers. Some racial scholars even use them to argue that the common racial classification is flawed or even completely wrong.<sup>1</sup> Whatever the case, Reachmen do share an identity and a history, both defined by constant struggles. Struggle against outsiders, against their land and against each other. Truly the people are in the image of their land: rough, violent, cruel and nigh-impossible to tame.</p> <p>The identity of the first settlers of the region, Elves or Nedic humans, is still hotly debated as archeological evidence is unclear on the matter, but what is certain is that by the Late Merethic Era both groups were firmly established and had interbred considerably. The first historical mention of Reachmen comes to us from Khosey's Tamrielian Tractates, as they describe the Nordic King Vrage's conquest of the region: \"...these Elf-blooded warriors, wielding spear in one hand and witch-art in the other, brave as any Child of Kyne, but heathen in faith and foul in nature.\" The natives of the Reach would then go unmetionned by history until the region was conquered by High Rock Altmer in 1E 385.^(2) From then on, Altmer (later Bretons) and Nords would constantly fight over control of the Reach for, despite its poor agricultural value, it holds vast mineral wealth (iron, orchiclachum and, above all, silver).</p> <p>In the early eighth century, in order to escape retribution from Nords and Bretons alike, several clans settled the abandonned Dwarven city of Nchuand-Zel, which they renamed to Markarth, after the river Karth. From then on, Markarth would be known as the \"capital\" of the Reach, inasmuch as such a savage people can be said to have one. Then came the Warrior Waves of the Redguards, which pushed the Nedes of Hammerfell, such as the Ket Keptu, into the southern parts of the Reach (modern day Craglorn) where they assimilated with the natives. Regardless of which kings claimed sovereignship over them, the native clans made a habit of raiding any settlement found within or close to what they considered their territory. A favorite target was the city of Evermore, founded in 1E 983 on the banks of the Bjoulsae by the River Horse Bretons.</p> <p>The first real attempt to civilize the Reachmen came from Empress Hestra of Cyrodiil. Following her victory over the vampiric Grey Host, and High Rock's inclusion into the Empire, the Empress needed to secure the strip of land between Sunforge and the Dragon's Teeth Mountains which connected her holdings in Colovia and Rivenspire; this meant subduing the Reach. Her primary opponent in this struggle was a local rebel leader by the name of \"Red Eagle\" who, despite his complete failure, went on to become a legendary, even central, figure of Reach folklore, as their greatest warrior, the first one of them to ally with Hagravens and the first Briarheart warrior (see below). To administer this region, Hestra founded the city of Dragonstar (merging several minor settlements) in 1E 1032 and made kings several of her lieutenants. Despite the obvious benefits of Imperial civilization,^(3) scarcely a decade passed without the Empire having to put down a rebellion, at great cost, in the Reach until its collapse thirteen centuries later.</p> <p>The Reachmen were the first enemy to fall before the might of Reman's new legions as the Army of Reman turned from defeating the Akaviri to conquering Tamriel. However Reman had no interest in letting his heirs and himself be mired in the struggle for control of the Reach and instiead decided to cleave the land in three parts. As he created the official Provincial division of the continent that the Empire would use into the Fourth Era, Reman divided the Reach between the Western Reach of High Rock, the Reach Hold of Skyrim and Upper Craglorn in Hammerfell, \"giving\" the lands to Bretons, Nords and Redguards (a Forebear family of Dragonstar was granted kignship of the region as reward for their loyalty), and giving the Reachfolk three enemies to defeat instead of one, and in doing so ensured that taxes would flow to Cyrodiil and that his vassals would remain occupied putting down his enemies. Reman Cyrodiil did more to pacify the Reach with words on parchments than the Alessians did with cohorts upon cohorts of soldiers. It is irony then, perhaps, that his Empire would, in the Second Era, fall under the rule of Reachmen.</p> <p>Though short-lived, the \"Longhouse Dynasty\" of Reachmen Emperors that ruled Cyrodiil during the Interregnum is an important landmark in the history of the Reach as unprecendeted wealth flowed to the region and many clans began to adopt rough forms of Cyrodiilic culture, leading to the division between the \"Imperialized\" and \"Wilder\" clans. Ultimately the Longhouse Emperors were destroyed by Colovian Rebels and it would take centuries for the Reach to once again coalesce into a proper fighting force, just in time to fall before the might of Tiber Septim at the battle of Old H'roldan.^(4) Under the Third Empire, the \"Imperialization\" of the Reachfolk continued, such that more and more of them abandonned their barabric customs and worship, to become proper Imperial citizens. The rest by contrast, embraced their dark heritage to a sadistic extent, perpetrating veritable campaign of terrors on the settlements of the region.</p> <p>Following the Tibedetha Incident of 4E 203, the Druadach mountains underwent earthquakes of unprecedented magnitude, accompanied by a veritable epidemic of lycanthropy. The chaos of the region was only magnified by the advent of the Silver Plague, which the Wilder clans interpreted as a gift from the Daedra Lord Peryite. Fanatics deliberetaly sought to contract the disease so that they could spread it among their \"enemies\", multiplying the death toll and creating a climate of paranoia among the survivors. In 4E 227, a warlady by the name of Melusa Swordclaw managed to unite the clans of the Western Reach and take over Evermore after a bloody campaing against both Bretons and River-Nomads. Markarth followed in 4E 235, whereupon Melusa crowned herself Ard (queen) of Markarth and founder of the Druadach Kingdom. The third major city of the Kindgom, Dragonstar, fell in 4E 251. The Kingdom reached its maximal expansion with the taking of Jehenna in 4E 280 which Greater Wrothgaria and Karth retook twelve years later, leading to it stabilizing into the borders that still more-or-less stand to this day.</p> <p>This violent history easily explains the Reachmen's obession with \"freedom\" (by which they mean a dogged refusal to let go of outdated customs and a refusal to compromise on the smallest of issues), which has caused the successive Ards a great deal of troubles when it comes to making those disparate people work together. The most obvious point of contention is, predictably, religious, as Bretons, Cyrodiils and most Nords follow the Imperial Pantheon, the Wilders the \"Old Gods\" and a minority of Nords, Orcs and Redguards their respective cultural deities. To alleviate this issue, the government preaches the so-called \"Melusan Truth\", which claims all those gods are but guises taken on by primal spirits that somehow integrates the wanton brutality of the most barbaric of Daedra with the grace of the gentlest of Aedra.^(5) Taking clear inspiration from the Rebirth of Saint Nerevar, the Ards also claim to be the reincarnation of Red Eagle, in order to cash in his wide appeal.</p> <p>The smallest administrative unit of the Kingdom is the clan (de jure clans were created for the non-Reachmen citizens of the Kingdom such as the \"Karthwasten Nords\") which can range in size from a few dozens to a few thousands members. Each clan has its own traditions and a chieftain (who is responsible for the collection of taxes and the enforcement of laws), usually picked by popular support (though hereditary chieftains exist). The Ard of Markarth is Chief of Chiefs and passes this position to his or her eldest child, but maybe challenged for the right to rule by any chief, or be deposed by the Hroldan Council. This council, made up of priests and vateshrans (bards), which serves as the highest arbiter of law in the land, gathers under the auspices of the \"Lord of Ash and Bone\". This mostly sensible system is undercut by the fact that any individual who gathers a large enough following may create their own new clan and that clans are not obligated to recognize the authority of the king, creating constant political instability as clans fight each other for prominence.^(6)</p> <p>Throughout the Kingdom's history, the Ards have endeavoured to built a modern nation, launching ambitious agricultural and mining projects, which have systematically been met with hostility by the Wilders on religious grounds. But the most controversial of the Ards decision, is their alliance with the \"three monsters of the Reach\"^(7): Lycanthrope, Hagraven and Briarheart, which they use to counter the spellswords, dragon-monks and sword-singers of their neighouring kingdoms. Hircine (or the \"Tricky Hunter\") is the most popular god of the Reach, and therefore his progeny the manbeasts, are not as reviled among the Reachfolk as they are among more reasonable people. Werewolf, wereboar and werebear \"packs\", ranging from a handful to a couple dozen of individuals, freely roam the kingdom in exchange for their help in war. A number of foreign packs take advantage of this complacency to hunt in the Yokedate, the Iliac, Greater Wrothgar, Orsinium or Colovia before fleing beyond the border to avoid pursuit. Hagravens are wild witches who have used corrupt Daedric magics to turn themselves into half-birds abominations who wield very potent destruction magic. They are consumed by a need to destroy and defile nature, prompting to the most morally bankrupt of Wilder clans to place themselves under their leadership. Most infamously, they know the secret of the \"Briarheart\" ritual, where the heart of a sacrificial victim is replaced with a briar, creating a very powerful undead, slavishly loyal to his new mistress. That the honour guard of the Ard is made entirely of such cursed creatures serves as a potent reminder that the \"civilization\" of the Imperialized Reachmen does not run deep.^(8)</p> <p>Markarth is the largest city of the kingdom, it controls and exploits the largest silver desposits of the region. Its Great Temple was formally the Nordic Temple of Dibella and many traditionalist Nords still make pilgrimage there, despite it now being dedicated to both her and Hircine. Despite the city being built atop ancient Dwarven ruins, the Ards have always forbidden its exploration or exploitation, with only their own honour guard being allowed to make use of Dwarven arms and armors. This edict is allegedly due to the presence of a large tribe of Falmer in the under-city. Worryingly, a number of Reachmen warriors have begun incorporating Falmer weapons into their equipment.</p> <p>Evermore, the second largest city of the Kingdom has suffered from the collapse of northern trade, but has found a new purpose in being the main agricultural producer of the kingdom. It is also the home of Witchlore Academy, an institution that, in addition of teaching modern magics, studies the crude, devoid of analytical and theoretical framework but nonetheless potent hedge magic of the Reach's witches, witch-men, gravesingers, firecallers, water-singers, beastmasters, flesh-tenders rock-dancers, etc.</p> <p>The third largest city is Dragonstar, which is now an important mercantile stop for the carvans of the northernmost Mother-Navigators, the Baandari Peddlers, the Tamrielic Bank of Z\u2019en and most especially the merchants of Orsinium. But Dragonstar's main claim to fame is its exploitation of Nirncrux (commonly called Red brittle) which is used in particular enchantments. It is even speculated that the clans of dragonstar are attmepting to create ersatz Briarhearts, without Hagraven involvments through the use of Nirncrux.</p> <p>The village of Old Hroldan surrounds a circle of menhirs (standing stones) dating back the the Merethic Era and that the Reachmen believe to be their most holy place. While it is specifically dedicated to \"the Lord of Ash and Bone\" most priests are formed there.</p> <p>The citadel of Sungard seats at the intersection of the borders of the kingdom, Greater Wrothgar and Orsinium. As such it is heavily fortified in case of Nordic attack (it has already weathered three sieges) and its walls are adorrned with both Reachfolk and Orcish symbols.</p> <p>The Orcish Stronghold of Mor Khazgur is the northernmost settlement of the Druadach Kingdom. Because of this relative isolation, the orcs there consider themselves more akin to allies of the Reach than members and have on occasion become a baronny of Greater Wrothgar. However they have strong economic ties with Markarth as their great forges are the most productive of the entire kingdom.</p> <p>1. Sure, and Orcs were born of Boethiah's dung... 2. \"Unmentionned\" heh? What about the \"Breton\" mercenaries that joined Alessia's revolt in early 243, before Vrage did the same? I suppose \"unmentionning\" them means you don't have to mention how the Empire treated them. 3. Mainly having your land strip-mined for silver. 4. Naturally, no mention of the links between Reman's father, King Hrol and Hroldan (or should I say Hrol's Den?) nor of the ancestry of Talos's predecessor, King Cuhlecain, he-of-the-not-so-Colovian-name. 5. Yeah, because we in the Potentate are such champions of religious purity... 6. They take an inordinate amount of pride in the Ard \"not being a King\" because they can \"chose\" not to serve him. But any clan that refuse his protection tend to get piled on by the others as there's no consequence to raiding them without honoring the local war customs. 7. Pretty sure the author just made that title up. 8. Got to agree on the werevolves (hell, I hear the current Ard himself has wereboar blood) and the Hagravens. I've only met one of those once, when our ship had to make an emergency stop in some uninhabited creek in Reich Gradkeep and this ... ground harpy starts throwing fireballs at us for \"trespassing\" on her land. But the Briarhearts? I don't think they're undead, I mean, I've seen one drink soup! But they are very creepy, they always seem to look through you somehow.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sure, and Orcs were born of Boethiah's dung ...\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Freehold%20Republic/","title":"Chapter. Freehold Republic","text":"<p>The Abecean Sea is a central trade hub, locals would argue the central trade hub, in western Tamriel. The Strid and Brina Rivers of Colovia drain into the Abecean, as does Hew\u2019s Bay. Any sailor looking to travel north from the Southern Sea, east from the Sea of Pearls, or south from the Iliac Bay, will likely be enticed by the Abecean\u2019s many diverse warm water ports. It should be little wonder the history of the region is littered with heroic admirals, cunning pirates, and bloodthirsty warlords in equal measure. From the All-Flags Navy of Bendu Olo and Syrabane, to the infamous Ra Gada, to the likes of \u201cPirate Queen\u201d Fortunata ap Dugal, heroes and villains of every sort have left their mark on these shores. The cities of the area have grown rich from this constant push-and-pull, and a unique vibrant culture all its own has slowly evolved on the tumultuous waves.\u00a0</p> <p>The Freehold Republic is the ripened fruit grown from this hybridized culture. At the center of their society is the concept of the \u201cFree Hold,\u2019 a city with the rights to govern itself. While the details may vary from city to city, the general schema follows that each citizen has a vote at the city council, or \u201ckinhouse,\u201d where local laws are passed and a canonreeve (or mayor) is chosen. Jurisreeves throughout the city, appointed by the kinhouse, hear crimes and punish the guilty. Citizenship is recognized by the acquisition of a calian signet ring or talisman necklace, a unique piece of jewelry which at once symbolizes one\u2019s ancestry and place in the Path to Alaxon. The granting of citizenship to non-Altmer, and votes to all citizens, was at first met with some trepidation, but ultimately necessary for the Republic to function as an enterprise that could truly unite and integrate the many various cities and townships.</p> <p>Of course, through marriage and financial entanglement, most of these councils find themselves dominated by the so-called \u201cSacred Families.\u201d These families, (calani to use the Altmeris term, which has no perfect Cyrodiilic translation), claim to trace their ancestry back to one of the Aedra as recognized in the Aetherquartz Book and represent the merchant-nobility in the Republic. Each sends a representative to the House of Kinlords on the capital isle of Stirk, where inter-city commerce laws are set, trade disputes resolved, and a new Prime Battlereeve (or grand admiral) of the Republic is appointed. Said Prime Battlereeve has the authority to draft ships throughout the Republic, appoint and dismiss sub-admirals, as well as other regulatory functions for the Republic navy. Of the many patrician families, six have become pre-eminent through wielding strong spiritual, military, and especially economic control over their respective hegemonies. These Sacred Six Families have practically become political parties in their own right, adopting members of lesser clans into their ranks to bolster their numbers against opponents at Stirk.</p> <p>Stirk also sets regulations and elects the leadership of the Auridon Paladins, that elder order of law-keepers whose name is something of a relic. Once an organization of knights dedicated to the defense of Auridon, they now enforce the laws and regulations of the House of Kinlords across the Republic, ensure contract-breakers are taken to a proper authority, and suppress rebellion. The higher ranks of their order are truly a strange sight to behold; bodies modified by geomancy with reinforced malachite limbs and culanda-enriched ocularies.\u00a0</p> <p>The present political situation was born of necessity. Coming out of the anarchy of the Third Aldmeri Dominion\u2019s collapse, municipalities across the region were fragmented, and any larger government was more of an idea than a reality. The Abecean was under constant siege from Baandari pirates, the coasts littered with Pyandonean outposts, and smuggling a fact of life. Firsthold's Kinlord convened a council of like-minded nobles and merchants from across the Abecean to pool their private ships together under Auridon\u2019s might, and they elected Andil Elsinor of Skywatch to be their first Prime Battlereeve. With the combined might of these merchant families\u2019 wealth and power, the Pyandoneans and pirates were easily driven out. The Battle of Port Dibellum in 4E 247 especially was considered a turning point in Freehold naval history, and is now celebrated as Republic Day in every Freehold city on the 5th of First Seed.\u00a0</p> <p>With a united navy, the Republic began to consolidate its rule. The powerful patrician families quickly set about restoring order to lawless ports, securing trade routes, and generally stabilizing the economy of the Abecean.1 Unfortunately, the families have since been reluctant to share their power. Though there are a few reformers in the House of Kinlords, the guilds of the Republic do not have the same voice in government that ours do, and there is no moderating executive to keep the competing factions in line. The rights of the Goblin-ken remain a concern; granted freedom by the Republic to compete with Alinor,2 most Goblins nevertheless remain unable to climb up the social hierarchy.\u00a0</p> <p>The true heart of the Republic is without a doubt Firsthold, owed to its history, wealth, and prestige. According to local legend, it was the first hold, founded by Torinaan the Foresailor when the Altmer first landed on the Isle of Auridon. The most diverse and progressive of the traditional Altmeri settlements, it has been relatively welcoming to immigrants for much of its history, as evidenced by the benevolent reign of King Reman Karoodil and Queen Morgiah3 before their unfortunate demise at the hands of Thalmor butchery. It would be among the first cities to formally declare independence from the Thalmor during the Anarchy, led by the pragmatic Adariel Family who remain the largest power in the city to this very day. The exotic4 Diceto River flows through the center of the massive urban sprawl; a sprawl that extends upwards as well as outwards, enchanted skiffs taking travelers across the water and up the enormous edifices. Souldust from the enchantment workshops clog the air of the lower levels, and so the wealthy have largely moved themselves to the upper echelons of the city. The main headquarters of the Diceto Syndicate of Wizards and Enchanters is located here, that aristocratic rival to our own Nibenese Synod, and whose innovation in the arcano-engineering industry was vital to the early wealth of the Republic when the Silver Plague necessitated a rise in magical automation. Monopolized almost entirely by the Adariel Family, it is the engine by which they remain the dominant power in Freehold politics.</p> <p>Also based in Firsthold is the main office of the Praxic Consortium of Rightful Commerce. Formed in 4E 290, the enterprise has largely existed as a friendly rival to the East Empire Company, controlling trade and shipping in the Abecean and even fielding its own private navy and militias, to rival the Republic\u2019s state equivalent. The Praxic Consortium is managed largely by the Six Families, something critics are quick to label a threat to meritocracy5.</p> <p>Further south lies Skywatch, with its great shipyards. Long the conservative rival to Firsthold, much of that old bitterness was put to rest when the Isles rose up against the Dominion and the Elsinor Family, a line from the warrior caste with strong ties to the admiralty, formed an alliance with the Adariels. Together, with other like-minded merchants, canonreeves, and rogue warriors of the Dominion, they unified the uprisings across Auridon into a nascent republic in the early days of the Silver Plague. Between the local Shipwrights Guild and the Hightide Naval Academy, Skywatch is proudly considered by locals to be the home of the Republic Navy. Thus investment has poured into its industries over the last few decades as interest grows in supplying support to the Praxic Consortium as some in the Freeholder elite begin to harbor colonial ambitions. The Elsinor, for their part, insist upon the idea of imperatum av vea, that a strong centralized maritime state born on the seas will bound the peoples of the Abecean together for a common cause and defend them against common enemies.</p> <p>Across the Blue Divide we sail to Woodhearth, a city which is a healthy mixture of Bosmeri treepod and traditional Altmeri dwellings owed to the long history of their coexistence. The usual clouds of souldust one might expect in Auridon is noticeably absent here, due in part to local regulations on enchantment workshops that have earned the Bosmeri cities some ire from the Diceto Syndicate. It is also home to the Academy of Name-Singing, where students learn the fine art of nymic-deciphering so they become great stormwardens, greensingers, and Jephrine Paladins.\u00a0</p> <p>Woodhearth has long been a bastion for the Camoran Family. A branch of that ancient dynasty fled here during the Bloodtoil Uprising, and married into the nascent Republic. Indeed, the Camorans have strategic marriages as far as the Direnni of Balfiera and the New Ayleids of Sunnamora. But marriage alone is not how they have secured their power, for their flexible interpretation of the Green Pact allows them to engage in commerce in ways their tribal enemies in the Bloodtoil Pack would never tolerate, and their patronage of the arts have made them heroes to the musicians of Tamriel.</p> <p>Up to the Gold Coast is Anvil, once home to the Sailor-King Bendu Olo, whose many escapades across the western seas brought wealth and prestige to Colovia, not least of which was the famous battle of the All-Flags Navy against the Thrassian Fleet of the First Era. Today the Oloman\u2019s City is still as lively as ever, brimming alike with hopeful sailors visiting the local Lucky Mermaid Gambler\u2019s Club and pious theater-goers visiting the Coast Lily Opera House.</p> <p>Anvil is also the power-seat of the Umbranox Family. Tracing their lineage in that region back to the middle Third Era at least, they have somehow survived war and plague to remain powerful merchants in the Republic, the greatest advocates of individual liberty and artistic freedom among the patrician class, but some suspect more nefarious truths underlie their facade. The Abecean gambling dens and houses of ill repute are all known to be in the Umbranox pocket, and some go as far as to claim all organized crime in the Republic is dominated by the Umbranox Family. True or not, the Primate of Dibella has denounced the Umbranoxes, much to the support of the local middle class who are taken aback by the rumored corruption and hedonism.6</p> <p>Even further north up the coast we arrive at Chasegard, flanking the eastern shores of Hew\u2019s Bay. The city was founded by the second Warrior Wave in the First Era as another fort town for the conquering warlords of the ancient Redguards, which in time became a minor trading port for the Forebear merchant-nobility. Though often overshadowed in history by its neighbors such as Rihad or Taneth, Chasegard was poised to take advantage of the new world that emerged from the ruins of the Silver Plague much better than those competitors. Taneth remained loyal to the Elden Yokeda, much to the later immiseration of the citizenry (see the Yokedate section of this Guide), while Rihad was far too ruined by the fallout of two Great Wars and an economy-devastating disease which they failed to efficiently respond to. Chasegard, by contrast, was less impacted by the war and became an early adopter of the Freehold Republic.</p> <p>The oldest and wealthiest family in Chasegard is the Shraj Family, who control the mining and agricultural interests of the region. But they are especially known for their influence over the Geowrights of Zen, an elite order of arcano-priests dedicated to the transformation of the natural world into new materials that can benefit mortalkind. The Geowrights\u2019 influence can literally be felt all across the Republic, from the stone-wrought fashions and armor of the wealthy elite to the soul gems uncovered by their expert geomancers which power the Freehold economy. The Shraj have also been known to harbor refugees from the Yokedate, political castaways who do not agree with the Na-Totambu\u2019s religious reforms or the Yokedas\u2019 increased militarism. This has infused Chasegard and the surrounding region with an air of progress that, if carefully managed, could breathe new life into the Republic, or if not, risk breaking it down into anarchy.</p> <p>Setting course westward, we find ourselves in Abah\u2019s Landing. Founded, according to legend, by the conquering Prince Hubalajad himself during the same Warrior Wave as Chasegard, it spent much of the Second and Third Eras as a city of depravity and crime. Pirates and thieves from across western Tamriel once called it their home, taking advantage of Crown-Forebear infighting to control the surrounding peninsula, until the Fourth Era. The military reforms which brought about the modern Yokedate involved reclaiming Hew\u2019s Bane and transforming it into a proper military training zone. Disagreements with the religious reforms of the Redguard Emperor - or Sheklith - led to the city seceding from the Totambu and hitching sail to the Freehold Republic instead. It is capital for the at-Reymon Family, one of the least consanguineal of the Six Sacred Families, being willing to adopt almost any merchant or sellsword who has impressed them enough. Their privateers make up the bulk of the Freehold pirate-hunters along the Baandari Coast, and it is rumored that \u201cAbah\u2019s Blades,\u201d an order of dragonknights trained in No Shira Citadel, are in fact the secret agents and assassins of the Sacred Families.</p> <p>Now we must turn our attention far to the south, where the Abecean meets the Southern Sea, at the island city of Port Dibellum. The city is built atop old Colovian foundations dating back to the Reman Empire, with other architecture showing signs of Bosmeri, Altmeri, Khajiiti, and even Maormeri settlement.\u00a0 During the interwar period, it had become a safe haven for sea-brigands of every stripe, using it as an outpost for their raids northward along the Drowned Coast. The harbor had grown quite prosperous by the time of the Silver Plague, and a major outpost for the sort of pirate leagues that would come to dominate the Baandari Coast.\u00a0</p> <p>After the Battle of Port Dibellum, the situation shifted. The island came under the Republic\u2019s influence, and in another two decades would become its greatest stronghold against piracy. Consortium patrols in the area are common, and the streets are regulated by Auridon Paladins and Black Knights of Ebonarm alike.7 Otherwise, the city is known for its pleasant atmosphere, and unique culture that blends customs from across Tamriel and beyond; the local temples and shrines to Khenarthi, Jephre, Phynaster, Satakaal, and of course Dibella are each resplendent in their idiosyncrasies.\u00a0</p> <p>These are only the cities of greatest political import; consider also Greenheart (discussed in the Baandari Coast section of this Guide), ostensibly a member of the Republic but in fact dominated by the corsairs. Or the aforementioned Rihad, making a small comeback in the last two decades as a safe haven for free-thinking intellectuals of every sort, with a focus on political reform and curtailing the power of the Six Families. Vulkhel Guard has always been an important military city on the southern tip of Auridon, and there are discussions underway to join Gonfalon Bay into the Republic.</p> <p>The future of the Republic remains in flux. Some groups, such as the militaristic mercantilists in Clan Elsinor or the reformists of the Shraj, seek to further establish a true centralized government along the lines of rival powers, be it to strengthen the state or reign in corruption. Other factions, such as the Adariels and the Umbranoxes, prefer to cling to the decentralized nature of the Republic that has empowered private enterprise and free trade. Meanwhile, on the local level various towns and cities fight for greater independence from regional hegemons.</p> <p>Externally, tensions rise over trading and sailing rights to areas such as the Chain, Pankor, and the Systres. Some of the Yokedate\u2019s neighbors fear its expansionism, and look to the Freehold Republic to reign in the New Warrior Wave through embargo and blockade. Even in in the Auridon Strait, tempers flare as rival naval drills from Shimmerene and the Republic vie for the same waters. Southwards, the Republic continues to be pestered by piracy from the Baandari Coast, which has resulted in the Camorans invoking loose interpretations of \u201cMourning War\u201d and Rite of Theft customs to press former pirates into their service. Yet other ambitions look beyond Tamriel: the Praxic Consortium has announced plans to launch an expedition to trade with Yokuda, and at least one prominent Battlereeve has spoken openly of the need to lift the misty veil of Pyandonea and \u201cliberate\u201d the Maormer and their wealth from the tyranny of King Orgnum.8</p> <p>\u2014</p> <p>1Ah, the famous \u201cGold Coast Conquests,\u201d which could be described more accurately as: blockading ports that didn\u2019t fall in line, extorting trade routes, and crushing any and all competition.</p> <p>2\u201dGranted\u201d freedom, as if the Goblin rebellions were not organized across all the former Summerset Isles at the time.</p> <p>3Ah, our High Excellency\u2019s kid sister. History books don\u2019t say what happened to her progeny\u2026</p> <p>4Polluted, so filled with used-up soulgems that the river's now some strange multicolored hue.</p> <p>5If by \u201cfriendly\u201d you mean in a constant game of trying to sabotage each other behind the scenes. Sometimes it gets bloody, though they usually make sure some poor middleman is the one bleeding. And, yes, it is a \u201cthreat\u201d to meritocracy when the only way to rise in their big trade syndicates is to be adopted by some family of snobs.</p> <p>6There\u2019s no point in honey coating it, everyone knows the Umbranox family controls the Republic\u2019s version of the Thieves Guild. But they aren\u2019t champions of the common folk like they pretend, oh no, they protect favored landowners and people in their protection rackets. The other families tolerate it because it keeps crime \u201csafe\u201d and \u201corderly\u201d.</p> <p>7I\u2019ve heard gossip around the table in Greenheart that the Umbranoxes bribe contacts on the Baandari Coast to avoid Port Dibellum. Makes one wonder just how useful, or corrupt, those knights and paladins really are.</p> <p>8As if your sponsors at the East Empire Company wouldn\u2019t be just as happy to loot those continents.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Greater%20Wrothgar%20and%20Karth/","title":"Chapter. Greater Wrothgar and Karth","text":"<p>As you go north from Falkreath by the Legion road, you may see the most idyllic landscape - chapels with stained-glass windows, quaint villages, vast fields of lavender and flowers, hedged by the snowberry bushes, with the frost-resistant nord wheat only rarely interspersed here and there. Those alchemical ingredients, together with the rare furs, are the main export of the northern kingdom, and the landowners steadily grow rich by trade. You can see the signs of the prosperity in the rebuilt castles, the mantained road itself, the occasional imported enchanted device here and there.</p> <p>The capital city of Solitude is steadily amassing more and more visitors who like to see how life was back in the age of Septims. It is quiet and sparsely populated, compared to the trade cities of the southern seas. The port had reopened not so long ago, and the sea trade is slow, but many of the city mansions are bought out by the foreign merchants, which can only be a good thing for the prosperity of the city.</p> <p>The main square of the city is decorated with the dual statue of the Queens Elisif and Gwynienne, the founders of the realm. The Blue Palace is the dwelling of the current King and his retinue, although the court is held there only in the coldest months of winter - the rest of the time the monarch wanders across the land, imposing on the hospitality of his vassals.</p> <p>The great Solitude Seminary of the Divines occupies the castle Dour and the neighboring quarters, and is the prime learning institution of the Kingdom not only in the theology, but in the applied magic as well. The rigid traditionalism of the Temple had kept the practice of magic even more conservative, bound to the outdated paradigm of the Schools, than that of the barbarian engineers of the College of Winterhold. Most of the practitioners you meet in the Kingdom would be educated here as the lay members of the Temple, if not priests, calling to Mara and Stendarr for Restoration, Dibella for Illusion, Arkay for Mysticism, Julianos for Conjuration, Zenithar for Alteration, and Kynareth and Akatosh for Destruction.</p> <p>If you go off the beaten track, you would delve deeper into the past. The fields there grow only enough food to feed the baronies themselves. The hill-forts are not the modern massive earthworks, but the ancient constructions of dry stone, looking as if the Atmorans just finished stacking them. Unlike the uniformed retinues guarding the baronies on the trade routes, only the thane-baron himself and several men-at-arms would have any weapon or armor, many of it dating centuries back and carefully maintained.</p> <p>Going deeper into the hills and forests, you would meet even more strange things. Sometimes, there would be no thane-barons, with the people calling an Orc or Riekr chief their Lord. The chapels of the Divines grow rarer, with only the itinerant priests bringing the light of Aedra to the countryside. Where they do not reach, older and darker religions rule. Covens, witch circles, hedge spirit-speakers - dark and uneducated practitioners lead the spiritual life of the local villagers, mixing the oral traditions kept since the Nedic times with the most blatant superstitions. A push-and-pull relation with the Daedra Lords define those religions, where the deals and trades are mixed with the wards and banishment. Hircine, the Huntmaster, and his werewolves, seem to be the most common threat to be warded against.</p> <p>Even weirder will the things turn out if you go west and south. There, in the mountains of Wrothgar and King's Guard, the rule of the Queens and Kings of Solitude doesn't reach, no thane-barons have a grant to rule and protect the land. The sorcerer-knights of the Iliac Bay are similarly uninterested in the mountain villages, so the inhabitants are left to fend for themselves. There, in the forgotten corners, on the barely enforced borders, people defer to the Druids as the main religious, magical, and even political authority. Those wander from village to the village, or live in the remote groves, and seem to offer the advice, help, or even an occasional blessing.</p> <p>The author isn't such a specialist in the ancient Breton faiths to tell whether this faith or cult has any relation to the legendary Druids of Galen. The only one I have seen seemed half-mad, speaking in cryptic sentences, and hobbling on the malformed clubfoot - which looked like a hoof from the distance. Maybe, like such primitive religions tend to, they see such inborn defects to be the touch of the divine, the Slumber as they call it - which I can only understand as the title of Y'ffre.</p> <p>Maybe that custom gave origin to the rumors that the Druids loose their human shape in stages, growing hooves, and horns, and wings, and tentacles, until they willingly bury themselves and wander beneath the mountains as shapeless Wyrms. That I cannot tell, but what I have understood from the club-footed one babbling, is that they deny the existence of the soul and the afterlife, despite the ample evidence, and strive to join the Slumber, dying in spirit without dying in body.</p> <p>However that may be, and maybe despite those weird cults and not because of them, the mountains are unusually fertile - the author was treated to the fresh sun-ripened fruit and simple, but heady and sweet jazbay wine where the lowland villages had only potatoes, beans and weak ale to offer. The smuggling with the Iliac also seems to be thriving, as I have seen occasional enchanted tools, some of them of the Elvish moonstone, in the village houses. Nothing expensive or rare, but strange so far off the established trade routes.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Iliac%20League/","title":"Chapter.

This, by itself, is unremarkable. It is also unremarkable that when urban centres suddenly find themselves de jure independent, they quickly fall to whatever clique can organise the best militia. What is remarkable, however, is that two centuries later, these cities have still yet to rebuild the unitary kingdoms they were once ejected from. As such, the Iliac League is, in many ways, a devolution of politics that could only have been achieved by races as parochial as the Redguards and the Bretons.</p> <p>But we digress. When the plague first struck the maritime west, it massively depopulated the countryside. Aristocrats, suddenly without rural labourers, poured into urban centres, abandoning their traditional domains. What they did not abandon was their traditional role as the most militarised of the estates. Buttressed by strong tradition and superior armaments, formerly landed aristocrats and their knightly allies easily claimed victory in the various power struggles of the middle Fourth Era, called the Jirhbr\u00e9 in Iliac Pidgin. As these aristocratic cliques liberalised, the long meritocratic office of knighthood essentially became one with citizenship, primarily as a result of political reform and concession1. Now, effectively all political power rests with the knights, called gallants in the south and men-of-the-host in Lainlyn.</p> <p>Rulership: The Transiliac Diarchy and the Knights' Assemblies</p> <p>The Iliac League is, in theory, ruled by two elected kings2, but they struggle to exert true power over the league, and thus are little more than kings in name only. Each is based in Daggerfall and Sentinel, cities which have traditionally attempted to exert authoritarian power3 over the Iliac League by monopolising the entrance to the bay. They initially rose to this position by exploiting the plague. To explain: The initial depopulation of the countryside lead to massive crop failure; this, coupled with immigration into the cities, lead to massive food stress across the urban centres of the Iliac. The only contemporary polity which produced the surplus food needed to relieve famine was Alinor, largely due to the late Thalmor\u2019s intense agricultural policies.</p> <p>In exchange, the Iliac League developed a novel form of mass production using enchanted tools. They placed the souls of oxen into ploughs, those of spiders into looms. Although commonplace now, these techniques were a genuine innovation, at least for the time. However, sympathetic theories of enchantment are increasingly considered inefficient, and the knights still insist on enchanting one tool at a time. Using their combined navies, they made each other their respective export markets. Alinor provided raw goods, often agricultural, and the Iliac cities produced consumer goods and enchanted automation for the Sapiarchy4.</p> <p>These kings convene and preside over the mechanisms of state in Balfiera, a traditional compromise between Daggerfall and Sentinel. Basing the city\u2019s legislative and executive power in either city would grant one the capability to easily coup the League government\u2014the Iliac Redguards and Bretons have not magically become two parts of the same race. As implied, it is also here that the legislature convenes.</p> <p>The first chamber, called the Muster Assembly, is elected by blocs called Banners. Each Banner is made up of individuals who\u2019s total value equals the Muster Threshold, which is set by the legislature each decade. At the Muster Assembly\u2019s inception, this value represented the cost of mustering one-thousand peasant levies for a season, thus the name. Because of this, a hundred wealthy citizens could make up fifty Banners, and thus have fifty representatives in the Assembly, while a hundred poorer citizens could make up five banners, and thus send five representatives. The system guarantees those who contribute the most to the League\u2019s martial efforts\u2014and also have the most to lose if it fails\u2014have the greatest voice5. The Muster Assembly itself elects the kings and can write law, as well as confirm or reject law originating in the lower chamber.</p> <p>The Lance Assembly is named for the traditional weapon of the mounted knight. This is in spite of the fact that the works of Risandru Gnossu (4E366) have thoroughly proven that the vast majority of knights, even pre-pandemic, were not cavalry, regardless of the popular ideal. Still, the Lance Assembly is made up of representatives elected by blocs called Platoons, which are\u2014in theory\u2014the battle-ready companies that each knightly order could raise during war. Seats in the Lance Assembly are divided amongst knightly orders according to each order\u2019s size; because of this, smaller orders (especially those relegated to single cities) often have to form coalitions to battle the influence of larger orders (many of these attached to religious organisations spanning the whole bay). The Lance Assembly elects high court judges, sets the budget, and can pass laws.</p> <p>Admittedly most analysis of Iliac civics is purely theoretical. The privileges of the cities themselves are unbreakable by Balfiera\u2014the government there mostly represents a ritualistic confirmation of the cities\u2019 consent to non-aggression and mutual defence6.</p> <p>It is perhaps this dysfunction that has frustrated Iliac attempts to reclaim the countryside, which remains infested by a shadow society of druids and witches that Balfiera insists are merely upstart bandits. Reports (at least those that survive even cursory expeditions into the forests) suggest that a Witch-King, or witch-kings8, have seized the countryside, consistently besting the knights of the bay. The Roundtable Expedition of 4E311 failed so spectacularly that it nearly bankrupted the League and triggered the Constitutional Crisis of the Long Fall.</p> <p>Armed Forces: The Three Ridings and the Withering Armada</p> <p>It should be noted that these failures are remarkable. The League has pioneered novel forms of combat, including the Three Ridings Formation. This doctrine divides platoons into one third spearmen, one third sword-and-shield heavy infantry, and one third sorcerer. In short, the heavy infantry provide defensive wards and counter-infantry, the spearmen counter shock tactics, and the sorcerers provide offensive barrages, even from range. The Three Ridings are exceptionally strong defensively and have shown great success in amphibious landings.</p> <p>Regardless, failures to reclaim the countryside have damaged their reputation. Particularly as the lack of timber\u2014perhaps the resource most vigorously defended by these Jephrine witches\u2014has hamstringed the League\u2019s shipbuilding efforts, crippling what was once one of the most dynamic navies in Tamriel. This is as theFreehold Republic and the Potentate7 continue to push the envelope on maritime technology. It seems unlikely that the League's long-term ambitions of establishing a permanent colonial project in Yokuda will be fulfilled without such an advantage in oceanic sailing.</p> <p>Notable Locales</p> <p>Balfiera is the formal capital. Greater Uubael (once Upvale) hosts the Palatial Monastery of Jivil-m\u00e0-Bael, where the assembly meets. The island in whole is owned in condominium between the League government and Clan Direnni, making it the only land the government can claim to truly administer, and even then only by compromise. The combined investment from the Old Clan and the League has revitalised the island, turning it into a centre of military and civilian metallurgy, fulfilling the niche once occupied by High Rock\u2019s northern baronies. Dubbed the Niello Renaissance, armaments smothered in black and rich golden d\u00e9cor have become the signature of the Iliac9, typically employing a design philosophy centred on modern reimaginings of classical elven styles. Dressed in such armour, Ridings of knights notoriously look like a portion of the night sky\u2014glittering wildly\u2014that trawls across the earth.</p> <p>Daggerfall is the centre of the bay\u2019s northern half, dominated by the Knights of the Dragon; it is no surprise that the Iliac king originating from this city is also often the group's Landmaster-Paladin. The Kynaran Order also maintains chapterhouses here, often competing with the Dragons to consolidate the region under their control. They too have occasionally provided Iliac kings. Although the city itself continues to grow and prosper, it is not without ancient malady.</p> <p>The spirit of King Lysandus once haunted the city, and it seems the land is left with a weakened divide between it and the other worlds: Ghosts frequently patrol the city at night despite attempts at widespread exorcism. Many of these spirits, however, are benign\u2014as such, the attitude of the city has increasingly become \u2018live and let live\u2019 when it comes to their ghostly neighbours. Some whisper that when the League\u2019s enemies arrive on Iliac shores, legions of ghosts will wash across Tamriel, wiping the wicked away. These beliefs, falling under the widening umbrella of Bretonnic apocalypticism, increasingly characterise a culture terrified of the future10.</p> <p>The southern star, Sentinel, remains under the sway of the Order of the Candle. As a merchant haven and a traditional centre of Zeht worship, it is also here that the League mints coins and engages in what financial governance it can. The League's inability to harvest its own raw resources may seem to hamper their mint, but the Iliacs have admittedly formed robust solutions to this problem. Supplies of gold are gathered from the various rivers that flow into the bay, gathered by wide, incredibly well-made nets draped across their mouths. Silver, meanwhile, is harvested from the deep seas using alteration magic, transmuting naturally dissolved silver into its pure solid form. Once brought back to Sentinel, the two metals are alloyed into electrum.</p> <p>The Electrum Standard makes Iliac currency exceptionally valuable relative to coins minted in the rest of Tamriel. Because of this, the League's artisans and manufacturing companies can import raw resources from nations employing weaker coinage at significantly cheaper costs. As such, profit rates for manufactured goods are higher in the Iliac than anywhere else. (In dire situations, the League has even been known to apply negative tariffs on raw resources, keeping the gross economic output of the League consistently growing at best and consistently static at worse, even if this growth is usually lower than other states and their improving production methods.)</p> <p>Wayrest sits further within the bay than its cousins Daggerfall and Sentinel, and it was for this reason that it was snubbed during the constitutional birth of the Iliac League. The Order of the Rose has since divided into the the Order of the White Rose and that of the Black. The two now wage a shadow-war across the eastern bay. The White Rose advocates for the success of the Iliac project, while the Black pushes for Wayrest to secede, ideally dragging as much territory as it can with it. The Black Rose has been a consistent thorn in the League as a whole, receiving support from whatever polity the League is spatting with at the time.</p> <p>Religion</p> <p>There is no one religion in the League. Any in-group out-group delineation is done by the people's dedication to the ideals of decentralism and anti-feudalism. As such, hundreds of spirits thrive in the bay. The traditional eight maintain a comfortable position, and each city is free to adopt its own deific patron. Certain spirits like Vir Gil, Genius of the Sea, (if he does exist) have firmly remerged in the public consciousness, especially with the League's dedication to thalassocracy.</p> <p>This slipshod approach to liturgy likely contributes to the rate at which the Iliac seems to go through religious reawakenings. When the Niello Renaissance began, Ebonarm worship resurfaced (one can only assume niello colouring naturally lead to this), with various historical figures: Gaiden Shinji, Emeric, Corvus Direnni, etc., being cited as 'Ebonavatars'.</p> <p>The current trend, Bretonnic apocalypticism, seems thoroughly rooted in cultural trepidation. It does perhaps not help that sightings of Golem have steadily increased. Most reports are consistent: a brass giant, with a heart like a star, walking across the distant landscape. Any attempts to move closer to it result in failure, as these mirages seem to exist at a fixed distance relative to the observer. This is not alarming, or it wouldn't be, except that this apparently fixed distance is decreasing over time.</p> <p>Delving through ancient galleries and old memoirs, Iliac historians are beginning to realise that Golem is mentioned in the barest of terms by classical writers, and was even painted in the far distances of old landscape pieces, including those dated before the Warp in the West11.</p> <p>Must it really be admitted that it was always there?</p> <p>Closing Observations</p> <p>For the League, the future is dim and full of anxiety. In the south, irredentism brews, and the Iliac\u2019s lagging innovation may mean doom for their Three Ridings on Yoku sands. Their natural ally in this fight, Freehold, has instead been a traditional rival (along with the Potentate) that has frustrated Iliac trade across the southern seas. If tensions between Freehold and Alinor ever spill over, then the Sapiarchy may call on their traditional mainland ally to bolster the Altmeri navy, finally threatening Auridon's wooden wall. There are those who fear, whether mostly unfounded or incredibly unfounded, that conflict in the south may open an opportunity for Greater Wrothgaria and Karth to invade, restabilising the brutal tyrannies of feudalism over the bay12. (Indeed, street preachers claim this 'inevitable' invasion was spoken of in the Elder Scrolls, and will trigger the End of Time.)</p> <p>Any hopes of Balfiera responding to these existential threats are dashed by factionalism and political tendencies. The mutual separatists hope to dissolve the League, building two strong unitary states based on traditional ethnic lines, centred on Daggerfall and Sentinel respectively. Those who wish to preserve confederalism and liberty believe Daggerfall and Sentinel\u2019s mutual rivalry keeps either off the reins of state; ergo the League must be maintained in its current bickering form. Meanwhile, so-called \u2018Young Chevaliers\u2019 look to prelapsarian delusions of High King Emeric, hoping to ratify the formal federalisation of the League into a United Covenant of the Iliac States. That is assuming it survives another constitutional crisis13.</p> <p>For the League, one axiom holds true: Reform or die.</p> <p>\u2014</p> <p>1They call themselves knights, but knights have horses. The Bretons ate all their horses during the plague. You wanna be a knight, you gotta have money; everyone else gets a big \u2018fuck you\u2019 and the privilege of getting crushed underneath someone else\u2019s metal boot. A boot that still has big fuck-off stirrups, for some reason.</p> <p>2Y\u2019know, the thing about certain lies is that they rely on the truth. There are no kings in the Iliac League. Saying that's a sure-fire to get drowned in the harbour, actually. I\u2019d know: Every sailor\u2019s been there at some point, but I guarantee that some of my dopier crew mates would read this and agree with it. See, in the League they have things called Erhko\u016b. That means \u2018conductor\u2019. It comes from Direnni, so there\u2019s probably a close cognate in Niben-Tamrielic. At the very least, there\u2019s a better translation than 'king'.</p> <p>3Yeah, I'm sure back then that proto-Erhko\u016b were trying to exert 'authoritarian' power, but these days most of them are content with the little authority they have. Really, they just serve as military leaders for a decade, then move on. Well, except for the few times they did they try to seize power. At the very least none of them have succeeded yet? Testament to the state's ability to resist tyranny, I guess.</p> <p>4The Potentate\u2019s never forgiven Alinor for picking the Bretons over them. Helseth should\u2019ve known better; the Altmer weren\u2019t going to risk trading past the Baandari Coast, and the Sea of Ghosts just wasn\u2019t viable. Dunmer carry grudges though\u2014it\u2019s about all they\u2019re good at. I hope it keeps him up at night.</p> <p>5I can almost hear the author jacking himself off over the page. There's nothing sexier than plutocracy when it comes to parasites.</p> <p>6Well, if you take a magnifying glass to things you'll see that the League's government has historically stepped up when it needed to, during crises and whatever. All things wax and wane; ain't nothing truly static.</p> <p>7Ha.</p> <p>8Nice people, actually. Academics in Cyrodiil like to think its a big unknown but really the League knows pretty well what they're up against, they just don't want to advertise it so the rest of the world doesn't get any ideas of recognising the independent sovereignty of basically all their land.</p> <p>9I once obtained a sabre from Balfiera. It's black like ink, and there're gold tigers prowling across the blade.</p> <p>10To quote Zurin Arctus, 'shit's fucked and everyone's scared.' Yes, that is a real quote. No, I don't feel the need to source it.</p> <p>11I've seen it. It always walks towards the moons. Lonely old thing.</p> <p>12Wrothgar would never bare an occupation of the League. It would be an island of anti-monarchy within a traditionalist state.</p> <p>13A lot of idiots like to think that the League's problems could easily be solved by one strong leader. That's the issue with their holistic view of virtue and knighthood. Beauty, magic, talent, wisdom, kindness all just another part of essential gallantry. When you have such a culturally inflexible idea of goodness it's easy to put your faith in people\u2014even self-interested, vain, power-hungry people.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20New%20Ayleid%20Imperium/","title":"Chapter. New Ayleid Imperium","text":"<p>As one of the younger political powers in modern Tamriel, the so-called \u201cNew Ayleid Imperium\u201d (officially, the \u201cImperatum Adonai av Sunnamora\u201d) is oft-misunderstood by outsiders. No surprise - given its confusing usage of reconstructed Ayleidoon; its peculiar blend of Aldmeri, Colovian, and even Khajiiti religious traditions; and most of all the questionable desire to emulate the cruel ancient Empire that Saint Alessia fought so hard to overthrow. Indeed, there was much alarm in 4E 335 when the Imperium finally gained statehood after the coup of Kvatch, with at least a few Elder Councilors calling for economic sanctions. Thankfully, the moderating voice of His High Excellency won out and the Imperium was instead granted time to develop on its own, with some aid from the Tamrielic Bank of Z\u2019en.</p> <p>Ayleid Revivalism is nothing new; possibly as old as the fall of the original Ayleid Empire if one uses a generous reading of history. More responsible scholars might instead point to the short-lived \u201cDawnwood\u201d from the chaotic middle years of the Second Era, a small Bosmeri nation later re-absorbed into the Colovian Estates. By the Fourth Era it was gaining greater purchase among Cyro-Bosmer who felt alienated from their primitive cousins in Bloodtoil and inspired by the image of true \u201cHeartland Elves\u201d thriving in Tamriel. The movement also found some support among Cyro-Khajiit, disillusioned by the spiritual and political turmoil of the former Elsweyr Confederacy and interested in a past when Elf and Cat lived together as one. For people of any background coming out of the Silver Plague, the dream of building a new society guided by the Light of Magnus and limited only by the Magic of Knowledge seemed rather enticing^(1).</p> <p>The Imperium is divided into five distinct classes. At the top are the Adoni, wizard-priests and Defenders of the Faith. Each wears an adabal (\u201cspirit stone\u201d) cut from varla which glows with the Divine Mandate, and when that light dims their right to rule is revoked. Or so they claim. The institution is obviously borrowed from the Amulet of Kings of the old Septim Empire, though a Revivalist might claim the Cyrods learned it from their Saliache forebears. Beneath the Adoni are the Chaplains, the only other land-owning class, a large aristocracy of priests, mages, clerics, magistrates, and bureaucrats. Next are the Questing Knights, the officers of the military. Many Questing Knights can become Chaplains by conquering, purchasing, or developing land. It should be no surprise that the military has become quite large as many an Ayleid considers it their best path to land-ownership and wealth^(2). Plebeians are the middle and working class, followed by the lowest servants at the bottom of the hierarchy. </p> <p>Representation in Sunnamora is not like in our own Nibenay. The Adoni and the Chaplains send representatives to the city of Silvenar, similar to our own Elder Council at a glance, but there are no guilds of significance in that land, nor are there any of the other careful check and balances our Sagacious Potentate has put it place to prevent either the mobs or the nobles from achieving total power. The plebeians may advance through service in the military, the clergy, or the arenas. Furthermore, while some of the plebeians can vote on local citizen councils that have limited power in small-scale issues, the servants have nothing equivalent.</p> <p>We must also discuss religion. There is much diversity to be found in the New Imperium - though the Gods of Light remain dominant; Auri-El, Magnus, and Meridia. In Kvatch and some outlying Colovian communities the Primate of Auri-El continues to maintain an illusion of continuity with the old Septim Doctrines, with some notable alterations. In Miscarcand the Dawnway philosophy, initially a Wild Elf compromise with the Green Pact that evolved over the years, has become all but absolute as the local clergy attempt to commune with the Stars. The Khajiit of Senalana practice an interesting faith that re-interprets Azurah as the Guardian of the Firmament, Magrus only her Third Eye. Further south the more traditional Greenist Bosmer appear, alongside the Green Prophets who continue to practice their blood magic and spiritual rebellion against all authority. Esoteric cults of Hermeaus Mora and Xarxes have proliferated throughout the Imperium due to Freehold influence, but by their nature are difficult to gauge in numbers. </p> <p>Currently, the Imperium is at a crossroads. Though the Treaty of Xylo with the tribes of Bloodtoil has \u201cheld\u201d since 344, violence in the southern jungles remains common as the Green Prophets fail to keep the barbarian warlords in line. Nevertheless, certain bellicose members of the Imperium seek to march south, scatter the Pack and establish a port on the southern trade route. Others look north and east, with ambitions towards the divided Colovian Estates; especially the vampire-run city of Skingrad that is an abomination to all faithful of Meridia. The Potentate, of course, is working to encourage only peace and prosperity for this young people^(3).</p> <p>\u2026.</p> <p>^(1)They came close to telling the truth. All this talk from the nobles of \u201cancient empires\u201d and \u201crevived pasts\u201d is just propaganda to unite the masses, no matter what province you find yourself in. It\u2019s not like our own \u201cHigh Excellency\u201d actually gives a damn about the lost glories of the Septims or the sacred legacy of Akavir when his speeches are over.</p> <p>^(2)Their military is huge, too big to be sustainable. The Knights are always looking for new land to conquer, and the \u201cAdoni\u201d are eager to please.

New Thras","text":"<p>The race of beastfolk known as the Sload have historically been associated with their reclusiveness, practice of necromancy, and repeated invasions of other lands, especially Alinor, in the First Era. They were long reviled by the rest of Tamriel for the release of the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260, which devastated the entire known world. Their home, the coral island of Thras, was sunken into the sea by the All-Flags Navy shortly afterwards, an event which was widely celebrated as the \u201cFall of the Sload.\u201d However, the slug-men, as well as their home, miraculously resurged several hundred years later and began their invasions anew. </p> <p>As time went on, attacks from the coral island became decreasingly common, and by the late Third Era Sload sightings had all but ceased, with many speculating that they had secluded themselves on their isle permanently. Though they remained elusive throughout the early Fourth Era, the Aldmeri Dominion secretly prepared protective measures for Summerset, fearing an invasion while their resources were being diverted to the anticipated Second Great War. These fears never came to fruition, however, and Alinor remained unassailed.</p> <p>With their most aggressively pursued goal left alone at its most vulnerable and Tamriel occupied with the Second Great War, Thras\u2019 presence was nearly forgotten entirely. This changed when the Silver Plague began to spread. The Sload were immediately suspected, and when the Second Great War ended, expeditions to investigate Thras were planned by several provinces. So widespread and devastating were the effects of the plague, however, that no such endeavor was carried out until 4E 219, when a joint effort was made by the College of Winterhold and the Royal Navy of Greater Wrothgaria and Karth to finally see what had become of the inhabitants of the migrating isle. All they found when they arrived was a massive island that had seemingly erupted from the ocean, abandoned aside from a small group of religious zealots who devote their lives entirely to attempting to climb the Pillar of Thras, which expanded along with the rest of the island and now extends into the sky as far as the eye can see.</p> <p>Mere months after this expedition, perhaps because of it, Thrassian refugees began to emerge on the shores of Tamriel. They were at first met with fear and hostility, with many assuming that invasions were being carried out on their weakened provinces. Many Sload were killed in what are now called the Thrassian Fear Massacres. Eventually they were able to communicate without danger, though to the disgust and outrage of many, by sending reanimated corpses to convey messages to the local governments. Some Sload that reside in regions that are traditionally more hostile may still utilize this practice, though it largely fell out of use after the plague ended. </p> <p>The Sload made a lucrative offer: they wanted to live in these new lands, and to be accepted into society, at least so far as not having to fear for their lives. In exchange, they claimed to have created a cure for the Silver Plague, which they would supply to the denizens of their new homes. This was, of course, met with suspicion and incredulity, and no government initially accepted the offer. However, the citizens of Tamriel were desperate, and it wasn\u2019t long before they began to make their way to the secluded swamps and lagoons that the slug-men hid themselves in, offering up their land and homes in exchange for the cure for themselves or dying loved ones. Once the first reports of successfully cured Afflicted began, word spread like wildfire, and droves of men and mer sought out the Thrassian refugees, hoping to be healed of the dreaded disease. Eventually, small settlements came entirely under the ownership of local Sload, and many still preside over these towns as Barons.</p> <p>Greater Wrothgaria and Karth were the first kingdom to officially accept the Sload\u2019s offer, and granted them large pieces of land in exchange for a continual, albeit slowly produced, supply of the cure. Many others soon followed suit, although the Yokedate staunchly refused, and the anarchy in Alinor made it impossible for them to accept in a formal capacity. Thrassians can now be found all throughout Tamriel. Though some still treat them with caution or even disdain, they have largely integrated into society.</p> <p>By the time the first refugees from the Coral Island arrived in Black Marsh sometime around 4E 222, they were already becoming a common sight in other provinces, and their motives were presumed to be the same as their brethren. Perhaps this is what caused the traditionally fierce and unencroachable Argonians to let down their guard. The large, organized group of Sload that swam into the swamps of Lilmoth did not bring a cure, but the invading force that all had initially feared. They swiftly took the city, and the Argonians lost many in the siege. Across Black Marsh, preparations were made to defend against a full-scale invasion, but strangely, none came; the  group of Sload that took the city seemed content with what they had acquired. </p> <p>Attempts to take Lilmoth back were continually thwarted, the Argonian forces repelled by their own dead. But something else kept them away as well; the forest around the city continually seemed to shift, and any who drew near to it reported experiencing powerful hallucinations. The Argonian priests consulted the Hist, and the answer was revealed to them: the rogue Hist of Lilmoth, which had been involved in the infamous Slaughter at Lilmoth in the early years of the Fourth Era, had regrown from its severed roots. It seemingly assisted the Sload in their capture and defense of the city, and had perhaps even called them there in the first place. The Argonians, still suffering from the plague and the losses from the initial invasion, withdrew from the area around Lilmoth entirely, secluding it as best they could from the rest of Black Marsh. Two years passed, and though smoke began to rise day and night from the rogue city, nothing was seen of the Sload.</p> <p>During this period, Argonians began to go missing from their homes. At first the disappearances went largely unnoticed, as during the time of the plague it was not uncommon for some to simply die in their beds, only to be discovered later. However, as the vanishings became more frequent, the Shadowscales were called upon to investigate. When they did, they not only found their mass graves for the Afflicted empty, but also that rogue tribes of Argonians had begun living in and around Lilmoth. Whether they are willing residents or have been enthralled in some way is unclear, as no direct contact has been made with them. What is known is that the Sload of Lilmoth, now called New Thras, continually carry out experiments whose full purpose remains unknown. They utilize both living and undead Argonian laborers, the latter of which are occasionally used to communicate with outsiders, though never with the natives of Black Marsh. </p> <p>Primarily, they seem to serve arrangements with a small number of Tamrielic Sload who supply a Hist Sap concoction, commonly called Thrassian Grog or Grub-Rot, to dealers that peddle it along the Baandari Coast. This has been outlawed in nearly every province, not for its dangerous properties, but because it is produced with labor from undead Afflicted. Though no new cases of the Silver Plague have been reported since 4E 237, none are eager to tempt fate, and so New Thras\u2019 only export remains highly illegal. Today, the former city of Lilmoth remains untouched, the endeavors of its Sload rulers undisturbed, but watched warily by all who surround it.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Orsinium/","title":"Chapter. Orsinium","text":"<p>Chapter Draft: Orsinium (2/5/25)</p> <p>The history of the Free City of Orsinium begins in the early Fourth Era, with the sack of Nova Orsinium by High Rock and Hammerfell. Once a prospering and promising kingdom in the Iliac Bay, Nova Orsinium was reduced to rubble, its population slain or fled. Under the protection of Imperial troops, many Orcish refugees made their way east to Skyrim, where they found grudging acceptance by the Nords. Others yet wandered further afield, into Cyrodiil, mingling into the cities and countryside. In time, many Orcs would find employment and honorable service in the Legions, working as smiths, quartermasters, scouts and shock troops, with a few even rising through the ranks to become officers. In exchange for these selfless acts and fealty, the Mede Emperors saw fit to grant the Orcish people leave to establish a new Orsinium, guarded by the Seventh and Fifteenth Legions. And so the first foundations of Orsinium were laid in the Dragontails, on the border of Hammerfell and Skyrim.</p> <p>From its inception, the Kingdom of Orsinium had a troubled existence. Few Orsimer saw fit to travel to their new homeland, preferring their strongholds in Skyrim and service in the Legions. A succession of weak rulers and deep cultural divides between the various groups of Orsimer who called the region home prevented the city-state from the success of Nova Orsinium. Abroad, Orsinium was regarded as illegitimate or nonexistent, not even recognized as a province by the Empire.</p> <p>At the outset of the First Great War, the bulk of the Seventh and Fifteenth Legions were called to Cyrodiil to defend the Imperial Heartland. Through the course of the War, both legions were badly mauled, returning to Orsinium a shadow of their former selves. Combined with Hammerfell\u2019s newfound independence, this lack of Imperial protection caused Orsinium to become increasingly insular. Never mind that Hammerfell\u2019s internal strife prevented the Redguards from striking at the nascent city-state on their border, the perceived threat was enough for the Orsimer to draw inwards, building defensive lines throughout the mountains to the southwest.</p> <p>The Second Great War saw the Seventh and Fifteenth Legions deployed yet again, bolstered by Orcish recruits. Throughout the years of the war, the Legions fought the breadth of Colovia, under the direct command of Attrebus Mede II, cousin to the Emperor. At the war\u2019s nominal end and outbreak of the Silver Plague, the Legions retreated to Orsinium once more, and never left.</p> <p>The Silver Plague left Orsinium largely untouched, remote as it is. Indeed, Orsinium capitalized on the disorder in the north, expanding its borders as strongholds and proto-strongholds in Skyrim joined their brothers and sisters, and the savage Iron Orcs of Craglorn swore fealty to the free city. Wandering Orcs flocked to the banner of Orsinium, alongside Ogres and Goblins.</p> <p>The Great Free City of Orsinium, as the rogue nation is now known, sprawls across the Dragontails from Craglorn to the Reach. With the Bjoulsae wilds of Hammerfell to the south, the Druadach Kingdom to the north and west, and the Kingdom of Wrothgar &amp; Karth to the east, Orsinium is nearly inaccessible to traders.</p> <p>Nor does the nation make itself accessible. For most, all that they will see of Orsinium is the border towns - old strongholds once of Skyrim, chief among them the post of Dushnikh Yal, the main port of entry to and trade with the Free City. Indeed, it is said that no outsiders have entered the city itself since the Plague. Free access to Orsinium is heavily restricted, only allowed to those deemed Blood-Kin - a rare and dubious honor.</p> <p>The existence of the Free City has in turn emboldened Orcish raiders. Those making their way along the coasts and rivers may encounter Orcish traders peddling wares carried upon the backs of Yaks, flying banners adorned with Daedric symbols. While these traders may seem honest, their goods are in truth stolen - outlandish rumors of interplanar travel are simply that, rumors. It is believed that these traders belong to many small, scattered bands, raiding and trading amongst themselves and Orsinium to give the appearance of a single, united entity, projecting the image that Orsinium exerts an enormous reach across Tamriel, and the traders appear to have the backing of Orsinium, in turn protecting them from marauders. Any encounters in the Potentate are to be reported to the nearest Guard or East Empire Company outpost.</p> <p>Let me tell you of my people\u2019s homeland.</p> <p>I was not born there, though my father was. He left long ago, over some dispute, and made for himself a new life here in the Potentate. It was here that he met my mother and I was born. Oftentimes, I wonder what my life would have been like if I, too, were Orsinium-born. I have been fortunate enough to visit a few times - as Orc-ken, I am declared Blood-kin and welcomed, but this is a rare honor for outsiders.</p> <p>Orsinium is a beautiful but harsh land, there among the Dragontails. Pastures for yak and great terraces built into mountain sides feed the people, and dwellings are more often than not built from stone, quarried and stacked without mortar. Roads wind through the valleys, and there are no signposts save for the great runes carved into cliff sides, by which foot travel and airship travel alike navigate.</p> <p>Most outsiders will only ever see the border towns and strongholds, chief among them Dushnik Yal. It is here that most mundane trade is done - deals between Druadach and Orsinium for smiths and masons, between Wrothgaria and Orsinium for mutual defense, and between Snow-Throat and Orsinium for the ever-important whalebone, by which my father says the whaleships are made. Those not Blood-kin are not allowed deeper in, unless they hire guards and guides - a hostility that rankles many.</p> <p>The people of Orsinium are divided. Most are Orsimer, like myself - but that is a broad category. \u201cIron Orcs, Stronghold Orcs, City Orcs, and Immigrant Orcs\u201d, my father used to say. Four Orsiniums, always at each other's throats.</p> <p>The Iron Orcs - the Osh Ornim - make Craglorn their home. Brutal folk, even for us Orsimer. And a brutal land they live in. Craglorn sits at the edge of the Bjoulsae Steppe, and suffers near-constant skirmishes with the horsemen. Airships are anchored at the peaks of every mesa and hill, watch-platforms for the dwellings below. It is said that even among the Orsimer, the greatest smiths and stonemasons come from the Osh Ornim - a saying that seems to hold true.</p> <p>The Stronghold Orcs mainly make their homes along the eastern slopes of the Dragontails, in the lands of old Skyrim. Some call them the truest inheritors of Malacath\u2019s visions and code - something the City Orcs would likely contest. Dushnikh Yal is the largest of these, nearly a city in its own right. The strongholds subsist off hunting, herding, the ores of their mines, and trade - for most of Tamriel, the strongholds and border towns are the gateway to Orsinium. For the free city, they are but a front, and a convenience - easier to make deals with Druadach, Wrothgaria, and Snow-Throat when your envoys do not appear where they should not be.</p> <p>City Orcs. What to say? Inheritors of the grand dream of independence, made manifest. The Great Free City sits at the heart of the nation, a honeycomb carved and built from living rock, crawling up mountain sides, down valleys, delving deep into the stone. The mercenary dragon Nahfahlaar makes roost here, high above the airships and alleyways, the whalehouses of the Beseechers and the great arena.</p> <p>And the Immigrant Orcs. I suppose I would be one of those, were I to make my home there. A people apart, living together. Too changed by the societies we came from, hoping to find a new home, living in imitation of the true Malacathi ways. Many make their living as herders and workers among the terraces and mountains, or in the City itself.</p> <p>Besides Malacath\u2019s folk, tribes of Ogres and Goblins have found homes in the mountains, finding acceptance here where it is scarce elsewhere. Even clans of men call Orsinium home, descendants of the Seventh and Fifteenth Legions who marched back to the city they were bade defend during the Plague and never left.</p> <p>And, though my father would scarce speak of them, there are the Deep Orcs. The mage-Orcs, the engineers, the secret sects by whom the marvels of Orsinium are made. False Dwemer. False Orcs. Cowards and traitors, choosing to hide away in their bunkers and tunnels.</p> <p>The Deep Orcs hold close the secrets of their engineering-magic, and Orsinium in turn holds them close. Their - our - secrecy is the reason the whaleships are yet hidden - constructs of whalebone and orichalc and more, wrapped in moth-silk and painted with runes and the sigils of Malacath. With these, Malacath\u2019s domain of the Ashpit has become a gateway to all of Tamriel and realms beyond, bringing back strange and exotic wares, plying the sea-lanes along the coast to dock underwater out of sight. These traders can be found nearly anywhere - I\u2019m told they have a particularly profitable arrangement with the Sanguine cultists of Port Katariah, whom they supply sacred beer and wine directly from the Prince\u2019s own realm. Potent drink - it\u2019ll cost you all the regrets in the world if you can find a spare bottle.</p> <p>But most of all, the whaleships allow for communion with Malacath himself. The Beseechers - the mightiest warriors of all of Orsinium, the ruling council - travel to the Ashpit in great ships, and there enact ritual combat with Daedric beasts in arenas upon the skin of the whaleships. By this, they gain the right to commune with the God, who now rules his people by his own word and with his own hand. It is by this that Orsinium is unassailable, a fortress for our people.</p> <p>I long for the day that I may visit the harsh and beautiful land again.</p> <p>-Yzmul gra-Maluk</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Resdayn/","title":"Chapter. Resdayn","text":"<p>Despite what maps say, there are in actuality two or even three Resdayns, each headed by a different figure in an unofficial triumvate. Resdayn as controlled by the Hortator and the Grand Council remains a conservative aristocracy dominated by the traditionalist House Redoran. The Grand Council rarely even considers candidates from the other Great Houses anymore, and so the urban Redoran nobility have grown decadent and lazy. Visiting the capital of Blacklight, a traveler might think they\u2019re in Firsthold among the preening patricians of Auridon^(1). The warrior traditions of House Redoran have been forgotten by the aging nobility in their extravagant crab-palaces, but thrive in the rural strongholds along the Velothi Mountains and northern wastes of Moestring where brave frontiersmer do battle with the occasional band of raiders. Most of the city Redoran have never seen a real battle at all. The guilds in Redoran territory are almost powerless when the Temple is not around; all must work for the glory and honor of the House, anything else would be selfish and greedy.\u00a0</p> <p>Nowhere is the urban-rural divide more apparent than in public perception the Molag\u2019kena (literally, \u201cfire-scholars,\u201d roughly equivalent to Nibenese Battlemages). Founded by Redoran Councilor Nartise Arobar in 4E 49 to deal with the epidemic of rogue Telvanni endangering the land and its people, they deal harshly with mages operating without proper license from one of the Great Houses or the Temple. (Outlanders and Ashlanders are largely exempt from these laws). Many nobles consider their existence an embarrassment, a throwback to the zealotry of the Ordinators, marching through the streets in full bonemold dragging away foolish young mages^(2). To the folk of the countryside, they are considered heroes protecting them from the dangers of power-mad wizard-lords; dangers the Dunmer of Resdayn know all too well.\u00a0</p> <p>In Ald\u2019Ruhn, the rising power that is House Sadras plots to increase their influence on the Grand Council. As the (relatively) young Great House with no major holdings prior to the Red Year and the dark exile of Great House Hlaalu, the nobles of House Sadras are eager to prove their necessity to the society of Resdayn. They rebuilt much of Vvardenfell, and still dominate the majority of trade in the Inner Sea. Their mastery of maritime skills are owed to a smart blend of the warrior culture of their Redoran cousins, and the mercantile heritage of their spiritual progenitors in House Hlaalu. Their crafty negotiations with the Coral Citadels of the Dreughs have brought in many Dreugh mercenaries to the Army of the Hortator, much to the disgust of backwards-looking nationalists in the Temple who associate them with the \u201cRuddy Man\u201d of ancient myth.\u00a0</p> <p>The entire Telvanni Council, or \u201cParliament of Bugs,\u201d has finally been officially moved to Sadrith Mora where the Telvanni can be closer to the political battleground that is Vvardenfell. Port Telvannis was mostly given over to Sload immigrants during the initial peaceful wave of slug-men fleeing Old Thras, in exchange for cures to the Silver Plague. Not because the necromantic Telvanni needed the cures, they claim, but because they wanted to study them.</p> <p>Archmagister Aryon continues his multiple-century-spanning struggle to modernize the ancient circle of sorcerers, even appointing a Sload to be his Mouth on the Parliament. It was his idea to invest most of the House Telvanni\u2019s resources into rebuilding Vvardenfell shortly after the Red Year, and for a time this gave them a controlling stake in ebony and glass. Indeed, the great mining colony of Tel Nchuleft remains one of the most prosperous cities in the Telvanni territories. Using tonal amplification, they can blast away rock to find the precious metals underneath. There is danger in such techniques, such as tunnel collapses or permanent deafness, and so the Telvanni workforce consists mostly of ash servitors commanded by dust adepts.</p> <p>The Telvanni Masters also have ambitions beyond Tamriel. N\u2019Tani, Master Aryon\u2019s aforementioned apprentice, has already declared her desire to expand Telvanni influence as far as Roscrea and Esroniet, and Master Talvas of Tel Mithryn is organizing an expedition to Apocrypha to establish an outpost in Oblivion and discover what happened to his former mentor. Whether colonial expansion will be enough to finally force this ancient organization of wizards to embrace modernity remains to be seen.</p> <p>Narsis, the City of Veloth, is where House Dres clings to a dying hope. Having lost almost all of their territory in the Greater Deshaan War, they have found an unexpected alliance with the Archein tribe of old Black Marsh. Archeins have settled into what is now called the Scaled District of Narsis. They\u2019ve brought new agricultural techniques that aid in farming the swamps of southern Deshaan. More importantly; they\u2019ve brought hard workers willing to perform labor at very reasonable prices and proud soldiers willing to die for the cause of Narsis\u2019 freedom. The newly-adopted Argonian councilor tries his best to maintain peace between the two peoples, attending Reclamations Temple services on Loredas and Z\u2019en church meetings on Sundas. It is to little avail; two rival gangs ruthlessly patrol their respective territories in the city. The Camonna Tong assault Argonians caught on the \u201cwrong side,\u201d and Haj-Uxith does much the same to Dunmer. Only their mutual hatred for the Kingdom of Argonia seems to keep the two factions aligned.</p> <p>Resdayn as led by the barbaric Ashlander tribes is an eclectic mix of primitive nomadic lifestyles combined with a rising movement of progress and civilization. The Ashkhans of each tribe meet at the holy city of Holamayan to vote for a new Gah-Khan from among their numbers; a \u201cgreat chief\u201d who represents the tribal confederacy to outsiders and leads them in times of war. The Gah-Khan reigns for life, or until they lose an honorable duel, or until the inter-tribal council of Wise Women call for the Gah-Khan to step down. Though there are a multitude of Ashlander tribes and clans to encounter in Resdayn, most are allied with or subordinate to one of the Four Great Tribes: Urshilaku, Zainab, Ahemmusa, and Erabenimsun.</p> <p>Since the formation of this new alliance in the early 4E 200s, every Gah-Khan has been a member of the Urshilaku Tribe. The Urshilaku gained much prestige as the keepers of the old prophecies after the coming of the Nerevarine, and their numbers soon swelled accordingly with Dunmer clanfriends hoping to \u201cget in touch with their roots.\u201d They used this power to convince the other tribes to form the Gah-Khanate, and later took advantage of the Greater Deshaan War to strongarm the Hortator into recognizing the Four Tribes as independent nations with rights and territories in exchange for Ashlander help in that conflict. Controlling central Vvardenfell and the heart of Red Mountain, the Urshilaku have become rich off the trade of heart stone, ash salts, and - of course - ebony. Their farseers can divine the best places to dig for ore, and know when and where to move to avoid the fires of Red Mountain.\u00a0</p> <p>While half of Urshilaku continue to live as \u201ctrue Ashlanders\u201d wandering the wastes and living off of the land, others have taken to sedentary life, rebuilding ancient strongholds such as Marandus where the Ashkhan typically resides. The settled Urshilaku live on commerce, but still waste most of their profit in their archaic tradition of \u201csharing the bounty\u201d among the tribe, further attracting many slothful vagabonds hoping to join their hearths. They are the most politically engaged, feuding with Sadras and Telvanni settlers and prospectors who violate the old treaties by mining on Urshilaku soil. The land granted to the Urshilaku by the Hortator was once considered Sadras jurisdiction, and the rulers of House Sadras have not forgotten the betrayal, though for now they are afraid of grumbling too loudly. Meanwhile, the Gah-Khan works to maintain an uneasy alliance with House Redoran and the Temple, not helped by the various religious and cultural divides. Their detractors among the tribes are put off by the growing \u201csoftness\u201d of the Urshilaku and the leading Clan Sul, sometimes throwing around the name \u201cHouse Sul\u201d as if it is an insult.\u00a0</p> <p>If the Urshilaku are too civilized for traditionalist Ashlander liking, the Zainab must be truly abominable. After the Red Year, they were forced to relocate to the Fungal Lowlands and the Padomaic Crest on the eastern arm of the mainland, where they still reside today. Only a small minority still lives as herders and hunters, most have become farmers, egg miners, and sailors. The gulakhans act as merchant-lords ensuring a stable and orderly flow of commerce, abandoning the foolish ideas of \u201chearth-sharing.\u201d The Wise Women of Zainab have lost their theocratic dominance over the tribe, a fate they curse ruefully (and plot to undo). The other tribes look on the Zainab with envy and shame, while the Great Houses Dres and Sadras both compete for alliance with the Zainab Ashkhan, who enjoys playing the two against each other. The true place to watch is the borderlands between Telvanni and Zainab, where the wizard-lords ignore the treaties and continue to act as if all of the eastern peninsula still belong to them.</p> <p>The Zainab are perhaps most proud of their insectoid livestock. They have saved several breeds from extinction - chiefly the silt striders and parraptons used for transportation, the sea striders used as transports and war mounts in naval combat, and skylamps used by travelers in dark ash storms.\u00a0</p> <p>The other Great Tribes are more isolated. The Ahemmusa of the Sheogorad region fiercely defend their home from foreigners, using the magic and tactics learned from their Nord neighbors (even if they would never admit it), and live a semi-nomadic lifestyle as raiders, ice fishers, and horker herders. Meanwhile the Erabenimsun, weakest of the Great Tribes, wander the volcanic Stonefalls region herding shalk and guar. Once known for their ferocity in war, the reformer Ashkhan Han-Ammu preached a new doctrine in the wake of the Red Year: that war, greed, and violence had been the cause of Resdayn\u2019s troubles, that a true warrior following the teachings of Veloth should fight not against flesh and blood but land and spirit. They see the struggle to survive the harsh terrain as a spiritual quest of continual self-renewal through experiencing hardship, and disavow violence of any sort except in self-defense (sometimes not even then). Needless to say, they have become easy prey for raiding Argonians and other tribes, and younger Erabenimsun are abandoning this philosophy to become mercenaries for the Great Houses.</p> <p>The two Resdayns are united in part by the Temple of the Reclamations, led by the Alma Rula. In the spirit of unity, the Temple has adopted many of the core theological positions of the Ashlanders: reverence for the Three Good Daedra, repudiation of \u201cdecadent living,\u201d demotion of the \u201cFalse Tribunal.\u201d They even consider all leading Wise Women to be Matriarchs of Temple hierarchy. The barbarians themselves are of mixed feelings about this as formalized religion is, according to them, exactly what Veloth walked away from in the Merethic Era. However, the spiritual (and often literal) marriages between Urshilaku and Indoril have brought much influence to both.</p> <p>The true power of the Temple lies in the Tongs. The Morag Tong, disbanded during the Red Year, lived on as a mess of petty successor factions for a time. After an unfortunate misunderstanding in Raven Rock, the Temple decided to officially revive the old order, but firmly under the control of the Alma Rula acting as an intermediary for Mephala. The servants of the Webspinner continue to keep the peace by resolving disputes without large-scale war. It just so happens that this now includes murdering hapless settlers trying to live on unused land claimed by the wandering nomads in their treaties.^(3)</p> <p>The Ouada Tong (\u201criver guild,\u201d for those of you lax in your Dunmeris lessons) grew up along the Thirr river in the central Deshaan region where, isolated from the rest of civilization during the Silver Plague, cenobitic monks and priests began to take the teachings of Saint Almalexia and the sermons of Tholer Saryoni to radical new heights. The opportunistic Alma Rula absorbed the Ouada Tong into the Temple as a sub-order and gave them a voice in Temple policy-making. The system is a far cry from the Elder Council\u2019s rational approach to peasant rights, corrupted as it is by religious zeal, and it has allowed the Temple to become a thorn in the side of more dignified Houses such as Dres and Sadras; condoning and at times even encouraging rebellions against the rightful nobility. Especially when said rebellions serve to profit the Indoril.^(4)</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>*^(1)*Where do the tea-sipping snobs of the Geographical Society get the idea to throw stones in glass houses here? At least the Redoran have some sense of duty to their fellow mer.</p> <p>*^(2)*From what I hear, only the really bad mages get hunted down. You know the ones, the freaks in dark robes muttering about unlimited power or whatever. Your average mage is fine as long as they don\u2019t go stirring up trouble.</p> <p>*^(3)*Unused land? I may spend most of my days on the sea but even I know how grazing works. And those settlers aren't so peaceful themselves, you know. Just last week I heard about a group of Sadras settlers near Lake Amaya burning tents and killing guar to scare off some Urshilaku nomads. Things got real tense before the Morag Tong \u201cremoved\u201d the leader of those settlers and warned the others to leave. I\u2019m just speculating, but I think there\u2019ll be another civil war in Resdayn before long. Those Temple priests can\u2019t keep the peace forever.</p> <p>*^(4)*I'll say this about those Temple Dunmer from Resdayn: they do take care of their own, even though they love to get condescending about it. No, what\u2019s creepy about the Indoril is all that death cult stuff. Some people think the bonecharmers of Cheydinhal are strange, but in Necrom half the city\u2019s population are the undead. Floating bonelords, skeletal guard nix-hounds, shambling flesh corpses of former priests. The living are almost as bad, covered in bone jewelry that supposedly allows them to constantly communicate with their ancestors. And they\u2019re always quoting scripture: \u201clearn by serving,\u201d \u201clet faith be your only law,\u201d \u201cdeath does not diminish, the ghost gilds with glory.\u201d Eerie.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Sapiarchy%20of%20Alinor/","title":"Chapter. Sapiarchy of Alinor","text":"<p>The fall of the Aldmeri Dominion and the rise of the Sapiarchy does not start with a fixed date: some cite the Tibedetha Incident which caused mass protest and unrest across the Summerset Isles, others give credit to the Goblin rebellions in Eton Nir and elsewhere, others still cite the Bloodtoil Uprising and the thinning of Dominion forces during the Second Great War, and none can deny that the Dominion always had internal dissent going back to the Stormcrown Interregnum. Regardless, the effect was the same. By 4E 207, the remaining Thalmor officials who had not already deserted their posts or died due to riots and in-fighting locked themselves in Alinor Palace, leaving the rest of their country to fend for itself. The Anarchy of Alinor, as this period is called, was a war of all against all lasting thirty years and saw Auridon divorce itself from Alinor as nobles, ex-Thalmor, and ex-military squabbled over land and resources. The Silver Plague only exacerbated the madness.</p> <p>The one bastion of sanity was the College of Sapiarchs near Lilandrill. Already insular and quarantined from the outside world, they mostly avoided the Plague and the anarchic chaos. The Sapiarchs, realizing the unrest could negatively impact research at the College, elected a First Sapiarch of Governance and an Assistant Sapiarch of War to enact a campaign of law-bringing across the Summerset Isle. The First Sapiarch moved into Alinor Palace with a council of advisors, cleaning up the remains of the dead Thalmor they discovered inside. Assistant Sapiarchs of Governance were distributed throughout the Isle to manage the other major cities. Satisfied with their work, most Sapiarchs settled into their towers to resume the \u201cmore important\u201d project of studying the Aurbis.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Yzmul: It was before my time of course, but I wonder how honest they're being about the so-called \"Anarchy.\" Sure is convenient for the Potentate and the Sapiarchs that commoners can't govern themselves. Thirty years of riots? How would there be anything left to govern?</p> <p>...</p> <p>Alinor City remains the official capital, receiving embassies from other polities, but lawlessness rules the streets. Infrastructure is failing, potholes dotting every street and ports haven to gangs. The Sapiarch's fifteen-year plan of economic distribution seems to use grossly outdated census data, and the Alinori City Guard are powerless and under-funded. The First Sapiarch has promised to deal with these issues, but they fall low on the agenda list after topics such as \"Determine the Laws of Divine Transcendence or Disintegration\" and \"Disprove the Mankariite Daedric Mundus Hypothesis.\"</p> <p>Lillandril, being the \"true\" capital closer to the College, is nearly spotless and immaculate - if lacking in basic freedoms. All citizens are assigned occupations based on aptitude tests when they reach adulthood and are tested again every fifteen years, while a committee of economic planning ensures everyone has what they need and nothing more. The Illumination Academy remains the premier learning institution in Alinor for the \u201ccommon\u201d people, and future Sapiarchs are generally selected from their most accomplished alumni. They have recently opened their doors to Goblin students, much to the displeasure of older Sapiarchs who fear what might happen should a Goblin score high enough on an aptitude test to be admitted as an acolyte in the College of Sapiarchs itself.</p> <p>The city of King\u2019s Haven nestled in the northern mountains is made up primarily of Goblins, who emancipated themselves and built a new society based on equality and respect for nature. Indeed, despite their mastery of enchanting far exceeding their former Thalmor overlords, souldust pollution is not a problem in King\u2019s Haven. Their runes are powered not by souls, blood, varliance, or even tonal manipulation. They instead focus and direct Padomaic creatia that radiates from Oblivion into their powerful inscriptions through a special technique of daedronmancy they refuse to share with outsiders for fear of misuse. They also have a proud chivalric tradition through the King\u2019s Haven Welkynars, a sect of air-knights who do battle upon griffins, wielding lances or magical crossbows. They have not seen a real war since the Anarchy, but maintain a strong reputation among the people of Alinor regardless.</p> <p>Rellenthil has always been a hotspot for artists and political radicals, who flourished after the fall of the Thalmor. The Assistant Sapiarch who \u201cofficially\u201d governs the city spends all of his time at the College. Instead, day-to-day governance is managed by a series of worker-owned guilds. An actor and bard guild called the House of Reveries, previously outlawed by the Third Dominion for \"subversive activity,\" was revived even more radical than before and has spawned a host of imitators. The House of Healing, the House of Glasswrights, the House of Tailoring, and so on. Unlike the respectable guilds of the Potentate, these \"houses\" tend to let anyone join and submit to mob rule. A faction of radicals called the Beautiful hold the most sway here, wearing garish costumes and strange masks and preaching the mad ideals of free love and common property, right under the nose of the clueless Sapiarch. All of the nearby mines, teeming with malachite, are barely used, wasted on frivolous art or fruitless experiments instead of advancing commercial prosperity. Most villages follow Rellenthil's model, especially in the more rural parts of the Isles.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Yzmul: I let a crewmate talk me into seeing a play at the House of Reveries while we were docked in Alinor. Pretentious gibberish, I didn't understand what it was even supposed to be about. Still, I think their guild system sounds better than the rich old guildmasters who spend all their days brown-nosing nobles on the Elder Council.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Shimmerene was hit particularly hard by the Silver Plague, and the \u201cCity of Lights\u201d is now more properly dubbed the \u201cCity of Ghosts.\u201d What traffic remains in the city consists of soldiers and cadets marching about in their glistening white military uniforms. The Sapiarch\u2019s Battle Fleet docks most of its ships in Shimmerene\u2019s harbor, overseen by Morlia of Skywatch, the Assistant Sapiarch of War.

Second Potentate","text":"<p>While the purpose of this work always was informative and educational, it was never meant to cover the history of our homeland. Yet after careful consideration the Editorial Board decided to give the Potentate the same treatment as the foreign kingdoms. ^1 After all, some of the readers may be unfamiliar with their own history, or this book will spread beyond our borders and serve as a guide for foreigners as well.</p> <p>When has our polity started is not a question that has a straightforward answer. Some of our institutions date back to the First Era. A significant cultural substrate is Nibenese, unchanged for millennia, and now exerting a considerable influence on the religious practices. An Akaviri revival and a discovery of the Remanian archives brought back the fragments of history abandoned since the First Era.</p> <p>A literalist historian would say, though, that the Potentate had started in the year 218, when the extended Elder Council first reconvened in the city of Cheydinhal and stepped on the path of restoring the Nibenay from the destruction wrought by the Second Great War, the civil war and the still ongoing plague. However controversial the last Mede emperor, Albertius, may have been, his Restoration of the Guilds Act has laid the foundations of Potentate's political system. Not a barbarous rule by the mob, and not restricted only to the arbitrarily defined nobility, the current Elder Council consists of both the members of ancient honorable Councilor families,^2 and the Guldmasters of all formerly Imperial Guilds ^3 who bring to the table much-needed voice of the working people.</p> <p>Other states can only envy the stability of such a structure, headed and moderated by the Potentate, an elected position.^4 The laws issued are the finest example of nuanced regulations that take into account the conflicting interests of all the factions and take the course that would be the best for all - think only about the Souls Edict, that so handily resolved all the issues concerning black soul gem trade and industrialized enchantment.^5 The day-to-day functioning of the state is carried by the meritocracy of the Civil servants, the highly educated bureaucrats that are selected and promoted through the regularly held public exams.^6</p> <p>Having this brief introduction behind us, we will now guide you through the tourist and business attractions of our homeland. River Niben continues to dominate and define the region, and the multitude of small rivers flowing into it support numerous villages and towns. The land that was allowed to lie fallow and grow over with forests in the Septim times is back in use, and rice fields with their irrigation systems, channels, and gates are a prominent feature of the landscape as they once were.</p> <p>Bigger cities of the region act as the hubs of trade, religion, and education, each of them special and famous in its own way. Cheydinhal, the capital, had grown enormously in the last centuries. Old city walls surround what now feels like a quaint city center,^7 while the city proper spreads now far beyond them on both banks of the Corbolo River. Building programs, variously sponsored by the state or by the more prosperous business owners, allowed to house all the workforce the city needs.^8</p> <p>Bravil is most famous as a site of religious pilgrimages. Petitioners from all over Tamriel come to beg Her Saints for intervention or offer their thanks, and the sermons of the Primates attract the most diverse crowd.</p> <p>Kragenmoor guards the passage over the Velothi mountains. In the times almost forgotten it was a center of Dres agriculture. Now, ironically, the city that once supplied most of Cyrodiil with saltrice depends on the Nibenese rice shipments itself. The ash that choker its fields is, conversely, one of the biggest exports, as it is used not only in alchemy, but as a component of new building materials.</p> <p>If you want to see the center of modern agriculture, look no further than Cropsford. Modern plantations, worked by the enchanted automatae, far surpass the productivity of anything that came before, and, fortunately, they weren't affected by the recent Souls Edict restrictions. ^9</p> <p>Ione lives up to the glory of the Legion Captain Tertius Ione it was named after. Once a tiny village, now it is the home to the most sizable Legion garrison. Their pikes stopped countless Bjoulsae incursions. Add irregular auxiliaries, mercenaries, and the traders plying the overland routes, and it makes for a lively, yet raunchy and somewhat dangerous city.</p> <p>If Ione attracts the most hardy and risky merchants that dare to brave the Bjoulsae steppes, Rimmen lies on the safer trade paths that go through Anequina. As a saying goes, 'you can get anything in Rimmen for the right price'. Even if it hints at the old racist sentiment towards our Khajiiti countrymen, the display of goods - legally - traded in Rimmen is impressive. Most of the moon-sugar and its derivatives that are so in demand for various rituals reach the Potentate through Rimmen.</p> <p>Gwylim has always been famous for its university. But what had been a small institution devoted to deeply arcane pursuits have become, with Synod's sponsorship, a center of modern learning. Only the University of Cheydinhal can equal it, but the foundations of modern soul science in the Potentate were laid down in the University of Gwylim. The accurate measurement of soul gem capacity, the methodology of astral navigation, even the translation of Remanian archives come from there.</p> <p>Last but not the least, Port Katariah. The black gem of the Topal Bay, it is the greatest shipyard and harbor of the modern world. </p> <p>^1 Meaning Helseth cashed out and they scrambled</p> <p>^2 Translation: Nibenese oligarchs whose ancestors bought that position in the time of one mad Septim or another</p> <p>^3 Fat cats that bribe and maneuver to get to the top of their respective Guilds - but also honest people among them, fortunately</p> <p>^4 That have been held by one Helseth Hlaalu for more than a century and a half as of now</p> <p>^5 Oh, yes, the riots and the strikes of 397 were glorious, the union of the laborers guilds paralyzed the whole country for weeks, pity they have decided not to push their luck and accepted the economic concessions</p> <p>^6 Translation: Helseth's faithful dogs that owe their positions to him only; unless you think those essays on Akaviri poetry are honestly evaluated</p> <p>^7 Meaning the villas and the mansions of the rich, the Palace and the Temple</p> <p>^8 Cramped 'islands' are bad enough, but the Potentate-built arcologies started decaying decades after they were built; unlike the ones in Port Katariah, those were done by the lowest bidder</p> <p>^9 Oh, how I hope that it will be affected - the farmers are fighting to be recognized as a Guild, and we are centrally going to have new strikes soon until they are; and Syffim will make sure that EEC thugs won't touch anyone this time</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Snow-Throat%20Commonwealth/","title":"Chapter. Snow Throat Commonwealth","text":"<p>If Skyrim\u2019s Civil War weakened the bonds of society in Skyrim, the Silver Plague broke them. Already stressed by economic failure, civil unrest, war, dragons, vampires, and religious upheaval, the arrival of the Silver Plague quickly fractured the north. People abandoned their cities en masse, returning to the ancient wandering ways; long-distance trade collapsed, the authority of Jarls shrank and vanished. To survive in the face of this, new bonds were formed: Nordic towns and villages, Orcish strongholds, and Giantish camps began to trade, wandering Voice-using monks helped to establish peace, and slowly, ever so slowly, a new order was formed.</p> <p>The Snow-Throat Commonwealth is the result of this chaos. The ancient Nordic system of moots has been revived at every level, the authority of Jarls and Kings decreased, and Dragon Monks serve as neutral arbiters of justice. Small, local town moots are formed from respected locals or elected members of the community, who then send representatives to the hold moot in the hold capital. From there, representatives attend the Great Moot every summer alongside the Jarls at the capital of Ivarstead, chosen in theory for its proximity to the Throat of the World, but mostly for being equally inconvenient to everyone.</p> <p>The Great Moot is Snow-Throat\u2019s national legislative body. At the Moot, the Jarls of the holds select a High King from among their number, who can be removed by a simple majority vote, while the Moot representatives hear petitions, debate and enact legislation, and advise the Jarls and High King on how to implement it. All of this is overseen by representatives of the largest Dragon Monk monasteries, who reserve spots for the ever-absent Greybeards.</p> <p>The Rift was least affected by the Plague, but greatly affected by upheaval, as Jarl after Jarl was overthrown by the disaffected populace, until an Orcish chieftain was appointed Jarl, much to his confusion. He and his descendants have ruled ably since, adopting Nordic customs and serving as High King when called upon. Today, the Rift is one of Snow-Throat\u2019s most populous and important holds, for agriculture and industry. Countless fishing villages dot the rivers and shores of lakes Honrich and Geir, and farming villages, plantations, and logging camps dot the forests. The city of Riften has never been cleaner, thanks to the efforts of the priests of the Temple of Mara.</p> <p>The Aalto is one of Snow-Throat\u2019s new holds, spanning the volcanic caldera south of Windhelm. The Aalto is a strange land, home to hermits, mystics, and hidden holy sites tucked among the steaming crags and hot springs. Most of the population lives along the banks of the White and Darkwater rivers, or at the base of the Velothi mountains. Wanderers and impermanent camps dot the interior, giants and their mammoths alongside Nordic jazbay collectors and hunters. In the south, the Silver Companions have built their mead hall and anchored their ships, protecting the sanctuary of the Eldergleam. Kynesgrove, the capital, is a holy site to Kyne, surrounded by a sacred grove from which the most senior high priestess holds court as the Jarl.</p> <p>Eastmarch is home to Snow-Throat\u2019s largest port and shipbuilding industry, from Lake Yorgrim to Slaughterfish Bay. A cool, forested hold, agriculture clusters at the banks of the White and Yorgrim rivers, and shipwrights ply their trade around the lumber mills and locks. The city of Windhelm is known as the \u201cCity of Skalds\u201d, home to the great Temple of Dibella, patron of the arts, and home to craftsmen, skalds, and artisans of Nordic, Orcish, Giantish, and Dunmer persuasion. Eastmarch is headed by Jarl Torghun Gale-Eater, the latest in a long line of sea-captains and traders from his family. Each prospective Jarl must first work their way up the ranks of sailors and traders, proving their worth as a leader before being confirmed as Jarl by Eastmarch\u2019s moots.</p> <p>Winterhold is a large but sparsely populated hold, a land of mountains and glaciers. Fishing and whaling villages are tucked in coves, inlets, and fjords, and covens of watchful Fryse hags monitor the Sea of Ghosts for signs of sea-giant raiders. The capital is the port city of New Winterhold, built on the shore of the Sea of Ghosts a few miles distant from its twin, the College of Old Winterhold. The port is small by southern standards but busy, filled with traders from Resdayn, Wrothgaria, and the Commonwealth itself, as well as deep sea fishing vessels. Increasingly, Winterhold is a casting-off point for daring expeditions to Atmora, seeking to explore and possibly resettle the distant land. The hold is governed by a duumvirate of the hereditary Jarl and the Archmage of the College, the Jarl\u2019s chief advisor. Winterhold is a popular destination site for Resdayni pilgrims visiting the great Shrine of Azura. The College and associated Jhunal temple are regarded as an oddity by southern mage-corporations, hidebound and traditional, yet trusted by the citizens of the Commonwealth for their wisdom, restraint, and focus on practical, cautious application of research.</p> <p>The city-state of Dawnstar is claimed by the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth, yet this is not recognized by most of the populace. The Jarl and aristocracy have close ties to the Kingdom, and indeed the traveling court has visited Dawnstar in the past, yet the city itself is governed by moots. Dawnstar\u2019s mines ship ore both east and west and the port is open to all, yet tensions may yet force the city to make a choice once and for all.</p> <p>The Pale is a cool, forested hold, stretching from the plains of Whiterun in the south through the appropriately-named Giant\u2019s Gap. This hold claims the largest and most active population of Giants, living in villages and camps in the hills and mountains while their smaller neighbors herd reindeer and farm in the lowlands. The Pale\u2019s government, as it is, is headquartered in Fort Dunstad, the most central location for all inhabitants. The hold\u2019s Jarl, the highest ranked commissioned officer of the local militias, is often a Giant.</p> <p>Whiterun, once the central hold of Skyrim, has shrunk. While still important, the hold and city are now much quieter, deprived of the east-west trade of days long gone. The ancient grain-estates still ship their produce up and downriver, the herders still take their charges onto the plains for their yearly grazing, and the windmills still turn, driving their millstones ever onward. The great Temple of Kyne and the Gildergreen dominate the Wind District, ever feuding with the Hunt of Jorrvaskr, while Dragonsreach sits above the city, home to the hold moot and the Jarl, elected every other year.</p> <p>Ilinalta Hold was once part of Whiterun and Falkreath Holds, separating as the Plague shut down trade. The hold stretches from the Jeralls in the south to the Brittleshins in the north, a hold of forests, lakes, and rivers. The hold\u2019s capital is the small city of Riverwood, a trading and woodcutting town situated on the White River. Ore, lumber, furs and fish pass through Riverwood, as well as traders on their way to and from Bruma via Helgen and the Pale Pass. As with other holds, the Jarl is elected, serving as both Jarl and mayor of Riverwood.</p> <p>County Bruma is the Commonwealth\u2019s newest member, formerly of Cyrodiil. Bruma, while resolutely Nordic, still retains the strongest traces of Cyrodiilic customs and traditions. The counts and countesses still retain more power, and hold strongly to their titles, while the moots are somewhat weaker than the rest of the Commonwealth. The city of Bruma is home to the great Temple of Ysmir, formerly the chapel of Saint Martin, formerly the chapel of Talos, formerly the Temple of Ysmir in days long gone.</p> <p>Snow-Throat is a wild and harsh land, still a wilderness in many ways. Sea-giant raids from the north are a constant threat, as are Falmer incursions from below. Vampire lairs hide in the caves and ruins of the wilds, and mystics, hermits, and berserkers haunt the wilderness. Yet the Commonwealth prospers - the moots have proved a rowdy but effective system of government, advances in mundane, mechanical technology by clever smiths work as well as soul-powered contraptions, and the people of the north have become more united and prosperous than ever before.</p> <p>Additional notes: Dunmer are present, but generally don't have distinct towns. Bosmer are common in Ilinalta and Whiterun. Argonians, Khajiit, and Altmer are very rarely found in Snow-Throat. Reachmen, Colovians, and Bretons are the most common human minorities.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Totambu%20Yokedate/","title":"Chapter. Totambu Yokedate","text":"<p>When speaking about the old Imperial province of Hammerfell, it is impossible to avoid mentioning the eternal confrontation of the 'Crown' and 'Forebear' factions. For obvious reasons, the tensions between the initial wave of settlers and the Na-Totambu aristocracy were exploited by first the Remanian and then the Septim colonial administration. The narrative of the eternal confrontation between the 'tolerant and enlightened' (meaning absorbing the Colovian culture) Forebears and 'barbarous and conservative' Crowns became so pervasive that Na-Totambu nobility had in time made it a point of their pride.</p> <p>It is no surprise then that the breakdown of this traditional opposition caused a deep cultural crisis in the contemporary Totambu society. But, perhaps, a more detailed historical excursion is necessary.</p> <p>The short period after the First Great War and the secession of Hammerfell was a time of great unity. Brought together by the hatred both toward the aggressive Thalmor and the spineless Mede Empire, the whole diversity of the Hammerfell society welcomed the re-establishment of the ancient title of Elden Yokeda by the current High King. The urban Redguards of all persuasions, discharged Legionnaires (many of them not local), even diverse nomad tribes supported the militarization and the subsequent comprehensive Army reforms. For a span, it seemed that the Lhotunic project had triumphed.</p> <p>The cracks had started to show even before the Second Great War. The High King died without issue, and his heir from the cadet branch of the family didn't quite share his views. Tracing his lineage from the ancient Phyllocid Dynasty, the prince was obsessed with restoration of the ancient glory of Yokuda. Forsaking the City of Sentinel, he had moved his capital to Hegathe, and crowned himself not as a High King, but as a Sheklith - which could only be translated as an Emperor.</p> <p>The war itself shattered the illusion of the peace competely. 'Forebear' Imperial loyalists and former Legion soldiers urged to join on the side of the Mede Empire, while both the Emperor and the Elden Yokeda bid their time, although for different reasons. The reasons of the conflict became ultimately moot, as the Silver Plague had devastated the region just as any other. The reconquest of the 'Old Kingdom of Hammerfell' territories after the Plague ended had become known as the New Warrior Wave.</p> <p>The kingdom had never returned to its old borders, however. Not only the 'Forebear' territories of southern Iliac Bay had resisted it in no uncertain terms, but many of the nomadic tribes of the desert had no desire to participate in the 'restoration of Hammerfell'.</p> <p>Without the traditional opponents to unite against, the Na-Totambu 'Crown' faction splintered into several contradictory interpretations of what makes a Redguard.</p> <p>The Elden Yokedas collaborated with the Temples of Sword-gods Diagna, Leki and Onsi, and they tolerate most of other worships, including the ones that syncretize the attributes of their gods with those of other cultures. First among them, the Temple of Tu'whacca-Arkay on Stros M'kai is famous among the pilgrims. The other hybrid worships include Mara-Morhwa, Z'en-Zeht and Kenarthi-Tava of the wandering caravans. Even the secretive individual Sword-god cults in the Army take on the characteristic features of both the traditional Nord hero-cults and Ebonarm worship of Freehold.</p> <p>The royal palace meanwhile works hard on reconstructing the original faith of Na-Totambu, excising the 'taint' of foreign worship with the iron hand. A new Temple of Satakal is led by an Archpriest, but considers the Emperor their ultimate spiritual leader. Among the latest innovations is the tax levied on 'false believers'. Fortunately, the doctrines of the Temple are amorphous and non-exclusive enough so that most don't make an issue of swearing to one more god.</p> <p>Where the royalists explore the religion, the 'young Yokuda' faction of the current Elden Yokeda had chosen to rally around the language. Yoku, preserved in the last centuries only in the nomadic areas and remote settlements, made a comeback. Not only the whole military bureaucracy of the Army had switched to Yoku, but the practice of granting Yoku names and surnames have been used both as an award (when given with titles and ranks to the former 'ra' - soldiers) and as a punishment (when military governors summarily put everyone with Yoku-styled names on census of their provinces).</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Chapters/Chapter.%20Wilds%20of%20Bloodtoil/","title":"Chapter. Wilds of Bloodtoil","text":"<p>The barbarian tribes colloquially referred to as the \u201cBloodtoil Pack\u201d are not recognized by the Elder Council as a legitimate nation-state or political body. Their ways are bloody and primitive; intentionally so, as they believe civilization a corrupting influence. You will find no embassy or consulate from the Potentate there. The only trade they do is with the Mother-Navigators, who still command respect from the Khajiit of that region, and the Minotaur colonists who have brought their Colovian values with them. Nevertheless, since the Treaty of Xylo in 4E 344, they have been recognized by their northern neighbors in the Imperium of Sunnamora and thus remain both politically and economically relevant. Therefore this section of the Guide has been compiled from the letters of diplomats, missionaries, merchants, mercenaries, and anthropologists who have risked life and limb among these peoples.</p> <p>The capital \u201ccity\u201d of Bloodtoil Valley is where representatives of the tribes, known colkectively as the Chorus, gather to confer with the High Prophet of the Green about matters both political and spiritual. Lest this hint of civilization fool you, dear reader, may we clarify that this tribal council rarely passes anything resembling \u201clegislation,\u201d and instead exists merely to maintain peace between the ever-violent tribes and discuss dealings with foreigners. The Temple of Bloodtoil itself is an eclectic structure converted from an old Wood Orc stronghold, and the High Prophet of the Green Prophecy spends much of their time inside \u201cmeditating upon the Now.\u201d Once a season (the locals count time in rainy seasons and dry seasons, not years), the High Prophet makes a pilgrimage to Deepwoods to confer with the Green Lady, who is supposedly the \u201ctrue\u201d spiritual leader of Bloodtoil, though no one except the High Prophet and their inner council has seen her in over a century.\u00a0</p> <p>The other spiritual center of Bloodtoil is Elden Root to the south. The Bosmer have regrown the ancient Graht-Oak city since the great calamities of the Second Great War, but how it has already reached the size of the old Elden Root is anyone\u2019s guess. The Bosmer here are bizarre and inbred; some covered in fur with jutting boar tusks, others wearing beards of moss, others still with insectoid eyes and antenna, and more variation than can be described. The natives claim their appearance is a \u201cgift\u201d from the Green. The more logical explanation is that their isolation from the rest of the world and their mating with Beastfolk have brought about such deformities.\u00a0</p> <p>Moonmont on the eastern border with Pelletine is the primary Khajiiti settlement. Built up by the comings-and-goings of the Mother-Navigators, a visitor could almost forget they are in Bloodtoil and not one of the former Elsweyr states. The Green Prophecy does have some purchase there, namely in the \u201cpart of the Green that chooses to be Khenarthi.\u201d The clan mother of the settlement sends a representative to Bloodtoil Valley, but her true power lies in the Moon-sugar. Many Greenists believe the sugar can be used to make contact with the Spirit of the Now, and her economic power is dominant.</p> <p>Verrant Morass is the closest thing the Imga have to a settlement. Made up of tree houses and stone huts, they are led directly by a Green Prophet. Indeed, the Imga are the most enthusiastic supporters of the Green Prophecy, and make up the plurality of Green Prophets. Some may see connections to the Prophet Marukh, but that particular Saint is largely despised by his own people. To the Imga of Bloodtoil he represents the obsession with civilization which had kept the Imga subservient to the Aldmeri for so long. Now they despise all things civilized, fixed religious codes most of all. They insist the Green cannot be understood with words or thoughts, only by some mystical \u201ccontact with the Now.\u201d\u00a0</p> <p>Other peoples also populate Bloodtoil. Barkbite remains a Wood Orc stronghold, and Harpies nest among the trees across the region. The river banks and shorelines are populated with Lamiae, while centaurs and faun roam the Tarlain Heights.\u00a0</p> <p>The most recent addition to the Pack are the most controversial. Tired of the constant Bjoulsean raids in Colovia, a few Minotaur clans immigrated to Bloodtoil and rebuilt the city of Marbruk. They brought the Cyrodiilic values of free trade and enterprise with them, practice an elective monarchy in the Cyro-Nordic style, and most horrifyingly of all - especially to the Bosmer and Imga - was their choice to chop down trees and irrigate farms. This resulted in a month of tribal skirmishes in the central jungle until the High Prophet intervened. Part of the truce involved the Minotaurs recognizing the Heavanly Bull, the Storm, and Shezarr as aspects of the Green. Alessia worship, associated as it is with hated Marukh, is heavily discouraged. More economically relevant, the Minotaurs were heavily limited in their lumber and agricultural practices. At the moment, the East Empire Company\u2019s friends in the Tamrielic Bank of Z\u2019en are offering generous loans to help the Minotaurs develop their colony.\u00a0</p> <p>In times of war, their armies are generally a motley affair, albeit a terrifying one. Imga \u201cGreen Knights\u201d welding bone-lances charge atop their Senche friend-mounts, backed by centaurs and satyrs. Harpies and Goblins riding hippogriffs act as the \u201carmy of the air.\u201d Bosmer Stags of Z\u2019en act as spies and assassins. Lamiae drag foes beneath the watery depths, as spriggan mothers turn the trees and soil against invaders. Needless to say, reader, travel in this wildland at your own peril.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>I was only in Bloodtoil for a short time. Met some Wood Orcs and Lamias at a makeshift coastal port. They were suspicious of outsiders, and made it clear our ship would be moving along soon. I don't think they were the violent brutes the Company would have you believe, but it is true that they prefer to be left alone. And hopefully it goes without saying those \"loans\" are anything but generous.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Cutouts/A%20Warning%20on%20Riekling%20Corsairs/","title":"A Warning on Riekling Corsairs","text":"<p>Seafarers in the Sea of Ghosts should exercise caution when encountering vessels adrift, especially near Solstheim.

This time however, the current Hortator, Gilyam Sarethi has made it known that he will not be seeking a fourth term. As a result, and for the first time in more than a century, the full Council of each of the five Great Houses as well as the leadership of the Temple of the Reclamations have come to take part. They are not the only ones to have made the journey however, as the Potentate has seen fit to send the Honorable Dante Luceveri of Bravil as Special Envoy to Resdayn to observe the proceedings. And of course, the Mouth of the Niben, in the person of yours truly, has come to keep you, dear reader, appraised of the latest goings-on in the East.</p> <p>The Honorable Dante Luceveri has deigned grant us an interview over lunch during this Thurdas, the second day of the election. The Potentate's special envoy is in many ways the archetypical example of a middle-aged member of the landed Nibenean gentry: jovial, well-read, impeccably dressed, devoted to Mother Mara (but not to the point of zealotry), clever and volubile.</p> <p>Greetings, Your Excellency, and many thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to address our readers. Oh, it's no issue at all, not at all. It is crucially important that the good people of the Potentate understand our neighbor clearly. Besides, we do want to get some value out of all those subventions your newspaper received last year. (laughs.)</p> <p>Could you explain the stakes of this election and why? Is the Hortator equivalent to our Potentate? Oh, on paper the Hortator is simply the military leader when a major conflict arise, is in charge of diplomatic relations with the Ashlanders, and gets a tie-breaking vote should the Grand Council be gridlocked. However in practice, he is the highest authority in the land. Especially since all Hortators since the beginning of the Fourth Era have also been Archmaster of Redoran, the most powerful of the five Great Houses.</p> <p>Diplomacy with the Ashlanders? Are they not part of Resdayn? They are of Resdayn, yes, but not subject to the Great Houses and the Grand Council. Legally each tribe is its own independent nation, and they form their own confederation, lead by Gah-Khan Sul-Yahaz. Ashlanders form a vital part of Resdayn culture, as they are seen as living memory of the ancient and sacred Velothi traditions (a claim disputed by serious historians), but they also frequently clash with House Dunmer especially over religious matters. Just last night a Redoran was killed by an ashlander for speaking positively of Saint Vivec in a cornerclub. In fact it's likely that without the Temple mixing both traditions and serving as an intermediary, both people would wage war.</p> <p>So the Gah-Khan is only there as observer and won't take part in the election? In theory yes. Though in practice his endorsement of a particular candidate has a lot of weight, and vice-verse when it is time for the Ashkhans to pick a new leader. And the same is true for the Alma Rula of the Temple of course. House, Temple, Nomads, the three corners of modern Dunmeri society, and their three leaders forming an unofficial (though hardly secret) triumvirate. The common people have even taken to associate each member of this \"lesser Tribunal\" with one of the Three Good Daedra.</p> <p>What is the process of election? It is extremely simple. The Alma Rula presides the proceedings and the five Archcanons keep track of the votes of each Councilor. The Hortator must be picked unanimously minus one and Councilors are not allowed to vote for themselves. They vote six times a day until a name is picked. As we have a full council attending for the first time in a century, this is likely to take a month or two, but Elves are nothing if not patient.</p> <p>Do you have any prediction as to the identity of the next Hortator? In theory any Councilor could be picked. In reality there are only two serious candidates. Feranos Sarethi, the son of the current Hortator, would be a natural heir to his father, but he is not very popular with the other Councilors who question his legitimacy to seat on the council. The other is Idesa Arano, the current Councilor of Solstheim. Her ebony mines make her one of the richest Dunmer in Resdayn and she has a reputation for being a cunning leader. Yes, I think she is likely to be the next Hortator. But the Sarethi clan is hardly going to let the position escape them that easily. I suspect a wedding will soon be announced.</p> <p>What about the other Houses? Couldn't they take advantage of Redoran divisions to take the vote? Unlikely. Despite his undeniable skill, Archmagister Aryon could never get the Telvanni Masters to vote for one of their own, since that would be elevating a rival far above their own station. House Sadras is not yet ready to step out of Redoran's shadow. They are most likely going to support whichever candidate will give them the best guarantees agaisnt their Telvanni rivals. All Indoril Councilors are former Canons and Mehra of the Temple and it is not in the priests' interest to rock the boat now. Better to play kingmaker, you see. As for House Dres, they simply do not have the political capital to rally people behind them.</p> <p>Speaking of House Dres, it seems their newest Councilor is the talk of the town. Indeed, Speak-With-Caution is hardly what you expect of a Dres Councilor, is he not? (laughs.) But it's not as surprising as it seems at first glance. The Archein Tribe has spent centuries selling their fellow Argonians to House Dres. Now that they are exiled form Black Marsh and that Dres is teetering on the brink of extinction, both are leaning on each other as much as possible. Speak-With-Caution's nomination was just the logical endpoint of that process.</p> <p>And yet it seems House Sadras features an even stranger Councilor. Do you mean the Dreugh? He's not a Councilor. At least not yet. Resdayn has been relying on dreugh mercenaries more and more to help keep the Argonian navy, pardon the pun, at bay. This success is owed to House Sadras, and their hosting of the Dreugh Ambassador is a simple reminder of their importance to their rivals. Still I was there when they disembarked and I must admit, the strange wheeled aquarium the creature uses for transportation was quite impressive*.</p> <p>You are, of course, an expert on Resdaynian politics, but if you'll forgive the question wouldn't a Dunmer be more suited to the task? Quite the opposite! As a Nibenese from Bravil, and a follower of Mother Mara, I can represent the Potentate without any of the biases that a resident of Kragenmoor would have, or at least would be perceived with. There is still a lot of bad blood between the Houses Hlaalu and Redoran, not to mention the dres occupation of Narsis where the ancestors of many Potentae Dunmer resides. No believe me, it's better that. Take the matter I am here for: a pack of Blood Vampires has taken to raid Potentate territory, that has long belonged to House Indoril but now is controlled by Hlaalu, from their base somewhere in Resdayn, likely in territorry that now belong to House Redoran but was House Hlaalu for centuries before that. Can you imagine how much trickier it would be to negotiate a reaction from the grand Council if I had family linked to these lands?</p> <p>What about the Sadras Councilor Selvas Drath? The two of you have been seen dining together twice this week and he is the third cousin twice removed of the Third Era Count Cheydinhal, Andel Indarys, who was close friends with our esteemed Potentate. Do we have allies within the Grand Council? Please, that would be telling. (laughs.)</p> <p>Well, that was the last question we had. Thank you again for your time. Is there anything else you wish to tell to our readers? And I thank you for the excellent work you do in keeping the people aware of the work we do on their behalf. As for your readers, I can only exhort them to work dutifully for family and country, to honor the gods and live a virtuous life under the wise guidance of the Elders and the Potentate.</p> <p>A.

I had to. Atmora! I know we\u2019re generations removed, but that\u2019s our homeland. Can\u2019t let the mages go on their own to see what\u2019s there. Besides, the pay promised for running the rigging on these ships was too good to pass up. Even the remaining winter fishing with all of the coming year won\u2019t make the pay they are offering. Guess that\u2019s why they were posting notices all over the RIft.</p> <p>There were carts waiting in Riften, like the notice said. There was a caravan of us going up to the Windhelm docks. They even hired an escort for the 5 carts of crew and supplies that they were bringing up north. Oh, but that yellow land before we hit Windhelm. It\u2019s like Pa after the spring willow festival with all those eggs. Guess you knew that, since you came down from Kynesgrove, but you could\u2019ve warned me!</p> <p>At Windhelm, we met the captains. They picked the crew for their 3 vessels and went over their rules. We were told that they already laid in crates of citrus from Cropsford. We get a daily ration and we\u2019re not to skip it. Figured they\u2019d give us southern crew a good warning about these long voyages in the cold and dark. I peeked in one of those crates. Those are much bigger than the ones we\u2019ve seen at market!</p> <p>Captain Ice-Mane selected me for his crew on hearing the name in the roll. Said he knew of the Spear-Fins and wanted my kind in the rigging when the ice gets thick. Did you know him when you were up here? He seemed to know our kin well enough. Definitely knew uncle Murphy. </p> <p>We were barely north of Windhelm\u2019s docks when a nasty gale brought in snow and ice off the seas. Captain Ice-Mane laughed at it and said Kyne was just toying with us before we reach the fun waters north of Winterhold, where the ice cutters sail. When the winds really got going, he thanked Kyne for getting us on our way. He wasn\u2019t concerned at all, but the snow was thick and we could barely see the lanterns on the other ships.</p> <p>Boatswain Delaney had me checking up on the backstays as he didn\u2019t like the work done in Windhelm. Said they always cut corners there and he ain\u2019 having it when we\u2019re going into the dark. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the work that was done, but I ain\u2019t second-guessing on my first day.</p> <p>Our watchers were calling out for floes. I could barely see them, but it was enough to cause us to correct a few times. When I was checking the stays and lines off the mizzen, you could see a few old wrecks along the way when the snow eased a bit. It would be just a few seconds. Kyne\u2019s winds would pause, let us see a ghost of what came before, then bring in the snows again. Perhaps Jhunal wanted her to let us have a good warning on the way so that we\u2019d stay vigilant.</p> <p>Just as we made it to New Winterhold, the storm broke entirely and only mild flurries saw us into port. You think the College up there had anything to do with it? Not so bad manning the yards into that port with only a light snow. It was beautiful! Kyne\u2019s Lights were competing with the lighthouse to light our way into the docks. If it weren\u2019t for the rocks and ships, the glisten of the ice and snow might make one snow blind during the day.</p> <p>There\u2019s a big inn here, where we\u2019re to stay until the next wave of crew and researchers arrive. Stuhn\u2019s Favored. You should see the whale on it! They must\u2019ve gotten a giant to carve it. I tried to draw what we saw as we came in, but I don\u2019t know if I did her right. One of the locals said it bodes well for us that they are having us stay at the inn and not on board our ship the whole time. Stuhn will keep us from meeting Old Mora, so long as we spend a night here, he said. They also have cross sweet rolls at the inn. As always, I\u2019ll make sure to buy a few before we head out.</p> <p>Don\u2019t you fret none. I\u2019ll be swapping to hide boots now that we\u2019re up here. I can tell I can\u2019t go barefoot for too much longer in this cold. We got a mix of Darkwater pine tar and Winterhold salts for our boots and gloves to keep us stable as we keep watch over the ship for ice buildup. I\u2019ve worked with Darkwater tar before. We\u2019ll be good and secure. I can hear you up here; complaining that I\u2019ll be as dark as the ship\u2019s cat and not fit for any matches you find. Well, if they can\u2019t take the tar, they aren\u2019t fit for me!</p> <p>Boatswain Delaney said we have time enough to go up to Old Winterhold tomorrow, if we aren\u2019t scared of the cold, and see her stonework. I might do that after my shift at preparing for icy waters. I would like to see it before we pass by the Skytemple Lighthouse.

The canal, initially proposed three years ago, would have connected Riften, [[Greenwall]], [[Shor's Stone]], and the Aalto in its original form, and opened easier trade between the Rift and the rest of the Commonwealth and beyond. However, this route was deemed \"A damned waste of time, money and resources\" by the College surveying and engineering team, among other rebuttals to the feasibility of the planned canal.

As proven by the White, Yorgrim, and Darkwater lock systems, such an assembly of locks, cranes, and runs of water is completely feasible. Instead, concerns centered around proposed construction sites and methods. Under the current proposal, the canal would begin either on the Treva River or at Lake Geir and descend to the Aalto in a series of switchbacks to meet the Darkwater at Darkwater Crossing, allowing longships to easily ascend to the Rift without portaging. However, such a route would require both purchase of large tracts of land from local landowners and usage of large amounts of fire salt explosives to cut through the rock.

Published 4e386.</p> <p>\u2026other forms of sky burials may be found across Snow-Throat. While the practices of Dragon Monks on the Throat of the World are most well-documented and formalized, they are by no means the standard.</p> <p>Sky burials are commonplace in the hold of Giant\u2019s Gap. Similar to the Throat of the World, much of the hold is unsuitable for conventional burials and entombment, dominated as it is by mountains and taiga. Cremation of bodies is often deemed excessively costly in terms of materials, especially among giantish clans.</p> <p>In the southern regions, most of the grain-towns will maintain a site several miles from their fields, typically a circular stone structure in which bodies will be deposited to avoid contaminating the soil upon which the towns rely. In the northern regions, burial sites are maintained among the mountain crags, demarcated by rock cairns and painted runes.</p> <p>Burials of this manner are highly ritualized. Upon death, the body is stripped of clothes and jewelry, then wrapped in hides lined with frost salts and enchanted to cool and slow decomposition. Family and friends of the deceased will then bring the body to one of the many sacred burial sites scattered across the hold. This journey serves a threefold purpose: to bring the body to be buried, to spread the word of the death to be recorded in the spoken records and annals of the Monks, and to collect the four figures required for each burial.</p> <p>The first required figure is one who has Kyne\u2019s favor, typically either a priestess or experienced hunter, to call for Kyne\u2019s blessing and acceptance of the deceased. (Note: Kyne, among her roles for the Nords, is a death goddess.) Second is a devoted of Ysmir Alduin, World-Eater, son of Kyne, the God of Mortal Struggle, who will witness the deceased and remember their life. Third is a devoted of Orkey, the most commonly recognized death deity, who will perform the rites required for the deceased\u2019s soul and body to be protected from the predations of the unknown. The final, and usually most important figure, especially in the northern regions, is a (relatively) secular figure, the Corpse-Thane. Appointed by the local moot, the Corpse-Thane is responsible for the proper arrangement and disposal of the body. In southern regions, the Corpse-Thane is the only one permitted to enter the burial structures to display the body for consumption by hawks and birds, and is typically a Nord or Orc. In northern regions, the Corpse-Thane is always a giant, for their task requires immense strength.</p> <p>Upon arrival to the burial site, the family and friends of the deceased will undertake a small remembrance ceremony, telling stories of the life of the deceased, drinking to their memory, and reading their wills. The body will then be given to the care of the four figures. In southern regions, the body will be unwrapped from the preserving hides, blessed, and reverentially placed in the circle by the Corpse-Thane, at which point the ceremony will be deemed complete. In northern regions, however, the process is significantly more involved. The body will be removed and repositioned, arms, legs, and head tied with rawhide strips to bind it into a rough ball. The Corpse-Thane will then take the body to the burial site, setting it on the edge of a cliff facing a steep dropoff or another cliff face. The mourners, devoted of Kyne, Ysmir Alduin, and Orkey will then join in a chorus of Shouts to imbue the arms of the Corpse-Thane with strength and speed, whereupon the giantish Corpse-Thane will strike the balled-up body with a club, imparting as much force as they can to send the body flying, returning the deceased to Kyne.</p> <p>Travelers in Giant\u2019s Gap have reported that bodies sent flying by such burial practices may end up a mile or more from where they were launched, shattered against cliff faces and mountains. Such northern burials are allegedly more efficient at disposing of bodies than southern practices, as the bodies are rendered into smaller pieces for hawks to feed upon.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Cutouts/Souls%2C%20A%20Primer/","title":"Souls, A Primer","text":"<p>An old research paper reprinted in cheap textbooks:</p> <p>Tibius Magdorus</p> <p>Skingrad School of Julianos</p> <p>4E 357</p> <p>The nature of the soul has been a matter of debate among scholars and priests for millennia. However, recent research has brought us much closer to the truth of such matters, at least as the soul pertains to the old \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d divides. Indeed, many misconceptions must be rectified, and that is the purpose of this paper. First, however, some history needs to be established.</p> <p>The original divide between white and black souls was devised by Vanus Galerion (2E 581) in order to combat the Order of the Black Worm by establishing legal \u201cwhite\u201d souls trapped from non-sapient beings and illegal \u201cblack\u201d souls harvested from sapient beings. This has remained the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of souls even to this very day. It is, however, a purely political construct which bears little similarity to actually existing modern research. After all, Galerion\u2019s old system of soul trapping defined the souls of Minotaurs as \u201cwhite,\u201d which would no doubt disturb our friends from Sancre Tor.\u00a0</p> <p>In modern terminology the \u201ccolor\u201d of a soul is not a matter of size or humanity, but content. White souls are raw Anuic creatia, formless and easily shaped by the psychomancer. All souls are white at birth; research performed by scholars at the University of Kragenmoor (Rallon et al., 4E 355) found that the souls of feti are not significantly different in substance from the soul of an ox or a goat, often weaker. Black souls are dense with psychic substance: as mortal souls absorb mythic pollution in the form of memories, emotion, knowledge, belief, daedrons, magicka and so on, the density increases, the soul becoming \u201cdarker.\u201d This process is a spectrum, however, not the crude binary dated literature might lead you to believe. The most common \u201cblack\u201d souls in usage, those of condemned prisoners, are not as dense as the souls of great mages; size is also known to be variable, mammoths and very old trolls often have souls as large as an average Dunmer or Nibenean (Adair et al., 4E 260).\u00a0</p> <p>In the past, necromancers erroneously believed black souls were inherently superior to white souls. Today enchanters and psychomancers have noted that both souls have drawbacks. White souls are generally useful for any kind of task, but are weak and therefore require a larger quantity for any given product. In contrast, black souls are much stronger but are specialized. Argonian souls, for example, produce more reliable water-breathing amulets and war veteran souls are more useful in combat-enhancing enchantments. Otherwise they are only about as powerful as a \u201cgrand\u201d level white soul, sometimes weaker (see again, Adair et al., 4E 260).</p> <p>Perhaps the most recent controversy in soul science has been the issue of \u201cSouldust,\u201d the residual soul particulates which are emitted from Ingenium workshops. They seem to have negative effects on overexposure; the Benevolence of Mara in Bravil (4E 356) reporting incidents of patients gaining memories of other lives, imbalanced emotions, dissociated identities, increased agitation, disturbing dreams, insomnia, and mental fatigue. A similar report found this \u201csoul sickness\u201d is disrupting natural ecosystems, killing plants and causing abnormal behavior in animals (Elisgan and Cassa, 4E 341). Counter arguments from the Chorrol Academy and the University of Skywatch refute this, insisting such diseases are more complex and souldust is a negligible variable (Doran, 4E 347; Larethal, 4E 350).

Despite the Nordic origins of the song, it has found popularity even in the most remote corners of the Breto-nordic Kingdom as well as in Giantish camps, Orcish vote-strongholds, and Dunmer merchant halls, forming something of a unifying cultural touchstone.</p> <p>Unifying, that is, everywhere but the places the song sings of.</p> <p>The collapse of the province of Skyrim at the outset of the Silver Plague rewrote the borders of Whiterun Hold. In the east, the city of Whiterun ultimately joined the nascent Commonwealth, its position on the White River creating easy links of travel and trade with Ilinalta Hold, the Aalto, Eastmarch, Winterhold, and the RIft. In the west, however, Rorikstead became part of the Kingdom, an important fort-town on the Legion Road that binds the eastern baronies of Wrothgaria together. The plains in between, largely bereft of permanent settlements, became something of a no-man\u2019s land: while each side claimed land, and indeed could exercise control over the closer regions, neither held complete sovereignty over the entire plain. Instead, the plains found themselves the domain of seasonal herders, to say nothing of the hermits, mystics, and Dragon Monks hiding among the rocks: giants and their mammoths from Whiterun and Giant\u2019s Gap, horse-tenders from Rorikstead and Whiterun, Brittleshin-folk driving cattle from the Hills, even goatherds from Druadach crossing through the claims of Wrothgarian qarls to graze their charges before returning to the crags of their nation.</p> <p>This pleasant state of disorganization, alas, could not last. In recent years, the gro-Bleds of Rorikstead - proud of their ascendant city and eager to claim the title of Earl - have begun to attempt to exert control over the plains, first by preventing access by Druadach\u2019s herders, initially by way of taxation and extortion, increasingly by threats and outright violence. Rorik gro-Bled, the current Thane-baron, has taken to sending his fyrd into the plain, harassing and assaulting herders - most of which claim citizenship in the moots of Snow-Throat - in attempts to drive them off, as well as burning and pillaging Commonwealth towns and settlements along the borders of the plains. Emissaries from Rorik have even presented his demands to Whiterun\u2019s hold moot, proclaiming the ascendance of Rorikstead over Whiterun. While the Commonwealth has given no response yet, many suspect that the Great Moot may declare war, pitting the militias of Whiterun and Snow-Throat against Rorik\u2019s fyrd in a brutal echo of \u201cRagnar the Red\u201d:</p> <p>There once was a hero named Ragnar the Red, who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead! And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade, as he told of bold battles and gold he had made! But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red, when he met the shieldmaiden Matilda who said... Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead! Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed! And so then came the clashing and slashing of steel, as the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal! And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no moooooree... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!</p> <p>Only time shall tell.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Festivals/Commonwealth.%20Feast%20of%20the%20Dead/","title":"Commonwealth.

The Queens' Day","text":"<p>Once a great city of the north, Solitude is now a shadow of itself. The harbor rarely sees a trading ship, and even then its most often a smaller shallow-keeled boat from Blacklight or docs/Wiki/Locations/Windhelm, or even Jehanna. The royal palace doesn't get many visitors either - for all the pretense of the royal family to greatness and the legacy of the great Kings, Queens and Emperors of the mankind, they are largely irrelevant even in their own kingdom. Only the Divines' Temple is always busy, and in the last decades had spread out to occupy the whole Castle Dour. It now houses the biggest Seminary of the kingdom, where the wandering priests of the northern version of the creed are taught.</p> <p>There is one day each year, however, when the city becomes the capital it once was. On 16th of Sun's Dawn the Unified Kingdom of Haafingar, Rivenspire, Karthald, Wrothgar, Falkreath and Hjaalmarch, or 'Greater Wrothgaria and Karth' in common parlance, celebrates the anniversary of its founding. Serious historians may argue about the importance of other events - the delegation of power to the thane-barons, the formal appointment of a single Heir, the signing of the Act of the Union - but for the common folk, it all began with the marriage of  Queen Elisif of Solitude and Queen Gwynienne of Northpoint. That the date coincides with the traditional holiday of the Heart's Day doesn't hurt either.</p> <p>^(Editorial Note:)</p> <p>^(The marriage itself should be put into the proper historical perspective to understand its importance. While permitted religiously under Mara's laws, and grudgingly accepted among the commoners, the marriages of such sort were looked down upon by the lineage-obsessed nobility of the fading Empire. And for all their claims to the opposite, the Nord nobility had taken up the Imperial ways. If not for the chaos of the subsequent events, the Queens' Heirs would have hard time defending their claim at Jarls' Moot.)</p> <p>The commoners from the most remote villages and mountain hamlets come in what can only be describes as a pilgrimage, and the festival celebration includes one of the biggest fairs of the year. The itinerant priests of the Eight Divines flock back to the great cathedral. By the evening, with its stained windows illuminated from inside and singing voices raised in chorus, it makes one feel as if transported back in time to the height of the Septim Empire.</p> <p>The parade of the thane-barons in the archaic armors of their Legionnaire ancestors tries to reinforce that impression, although everyone is aware it is mere costumery. The traditions of the Legions have died out more than century ago. The small leaders who were nothing but tax-gatherers appointed from the Legion veterans by the start of the Fourth Era - thanes, barons, chieftains - were granted the ultimate power over their small domains in the times of the Silver Plague. Their descendants now are the actual rulers of the kingdom, each one of them holding his tiny court in his restored hilltop fort.</p> <p>The policies they support serve to keep the Kingdom hamstrung, with its glory returning back only during the yearly festival - the disconnected self-sufficient thane-baronies have little interest in trade. The lack of communication and organization between their tiny domains, the complicated structure of obligations and vassalage makes the Western Kingdom even more fragmented and disorganized than rule-by-mob of the Eastern 'Commonwealth'. The predominantly agrarian population is largely uneducated, and lives from harvest to harvest, and thanes are glad to keep it so.</p> <p>YgM: For all I dislike that 'rulership by the virtue of owning the only sword in the village' stuff, you can't deny that their isolationism works for Wrothgarians. One of my drinking buddies from the University of Cheydinhal had a whole set of numbers about the Plague, its strains, mortality, all that. GW&amp;K got through it with the least loss of population, it seems.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Festivals/Iliac%20Bay.%20Balfiera%20Regatta/","title":"Iliac Bay. Balfiera Regatta","text":"<p>This particular festival is tied strongly with the Iliac Bay politics. The preceding week is devoted to the election of the two leaders who would guide the Iliac League through the next six years. By tradition, the candidates, and delegated voters from every city-state of the league gather in the city of Balfiera to present themselves and cast vote in person. Counting their ships with crews, and invited honorary guests, the population of Balfiera is said to double on those days.</p> <p>After the outcome of the election is announced, the celebratory part begins. The main attraction here is a regatta, a sea-race though all the length of the Iliac Bay from the isle of Balfiera to the isle of Betony. But that is not the contest of pure speed - packed cargo waits on Betony, its amount exceeding the size of a typical ship hold two or three times. Thus, it measures the logistical capabilities of the captains, and the endurance and speed of all the crew.</p> <p>From the Iliac Bay, each city-state puts forward its own ship. They all are much similar in construction - mid-sized, with two or three masts, mostly square-rigged, except for the gaff sail on the aft. Such ships have shown themselves to be capable both in the relatively calm waters of the Abecean Sea and in the open ocean. They are small enough to be fast and maneuverable, but big enough to carry the cargo, and the fighting complement of the marines and shipboard ballistae. There is no surprise that the shipbuilding of the rest of the nations is influenced by the Iliac designs to a greater or lesser degree.</p> <p>YgM: They are cheap to build, that's their main advantage. Freehold and Sapiarchy designs are superior in every way, but you can't turn them out with the same speed as those clinker brigs.</p> <p>The only ship standing apart is under the banner of Daggerfall. An example of Iliac martial ship-building, rather than mercantile one, Red Dragon is a seven-masted floating fortress. It isn't the biggest ship in the harbor, though.</p> <p>Similar enough to the classical Iliac brig is Hunding's Rage of Stros M'kai. She is lateen-rigged, though, in a more archaic way reminiscent of the ships of the Warrior Wave. And she seems to carry more ballistae than usual, including the compact alchemical ones hidden behind the clever hatches of the lower deck. There also appears to be no distinction between the sailors and the marines in the crew, as everyone is lightly armored and carries a sword at all times.</p> <p>The most impressive of the guest competitors is, obviously, the one from the Potentate. Saint Barenziah of Port Katariah is competing for the second time. She has been constructed as a flagship for the upcoming expedition to the Akavir, and now waits for the rest of the fleet to be built. Her dark hull is made of the finest Nibenese softwood, the multitude of independent sealed holds ensure that it stays afloat even when severely damaged. The fully battened sails from the closely-woven moth silk are dyed bright purple. A great treasure ship, she is slower than average. But she is big enough to fit all the cargo in one go, and the crew can populate a decent-sized town. Using the ship-mounted cranes, she can be loaded and unloaded surprisingly rapidly. Only the unfortunate low tide had prevented her from winning the race the last time.</p> <p>YgM: This bloated cow of a boat managed to run aground smack in the middle of the Iliac Bay. Independent holds worked well, though. So after the high tide she needed only three months to limp back to Port Katariah. Let us all hope they don't run aground in the middle of the ocean if and when they finally sail to Akavir. It's a fine bunch of lads and lasses serving on her, would be a pity to loose them.</p> <p>From the port of Alinor hails the beautiful Root Square of Minus One. The wrought glass ships of Sapiarchy, with their impossible geometry and wing-like sun-sails are rarely seen on the trade routes. The performance under sail is invariably awe-inspiring, but it is mitigated by the fact that the crew seems to be enthusiastic amateurs who don't see the open seas often.</p> <p>A less refined take on the same design is marked as being from the newly-constructed port town of Jode's Pocket. The port doesn't see much trade, as few merchants wish to go up the Strid river, but just as a ship itself, it is a testament to the fledgling Ayleid state ambitions. The ship, pretentiously named Valentis the Great, has been commissioned from the Sapiarchy shipyards. Doubly restricted by the unwillingness of the Altmer to disclose all their secrets, and the necessity to dock in the freshwater port, it came out too small for its sails, and a bit awkward on sharp turns.</p> <p>Two longships from the port of Solitude and the port of Windhelm stand side by side, as similar as sisters. Named Blessing of Akatosh and Kyne's Breast, both are in Atmoran style, and thus much different from the rest. Clinker-built from the long planks of the ancient northern oaks, their length is limited by the height of the tree itself. Shallow-keeled, broad and flexible, they show their best in the icy Sea of Ghosts, where they can go up the rivers on oars, and survive the impact on floating ice that sinks bigger and sturdier ships of the southern style. The sail plan is simplistic, though, and doesn't allow to sail as fast and as close to the wind. The Wrothgarian ship is all prettied up, with the sails and crew uniforms dyed Queen's red. The Snow-Throat crew, in comparison, looks as if they have wintered on the floating ice halfway to Atmora with only horkers for company.</p> <p>YgM: If that's the ship I know as 'Kyne's Tits', then yes. Yes, they did.</p> <p>The port of Greenheart is represented by Thousand and First Eye. Formerly an East Empire Company merchant ship, it has been claimed under the ancient rights of salvage. The legality of its aquisition is as dubious as a Free City status of the Greenheart itself, but too many interests are tied in to make an issue of it. Built in the Potentate many years ago, she started her life as a double-decked coastal galley. Such design, dating back to Mede times, is far removed from the splendor of the Saint Barenziah. However, recently it has been upgraded with taller masts and a complicated system of studding sails that unfurl to the sides like a pair of great wings - and which its agile Bosmer-Khajiit crew operates flawlessly.</p> <p>Similar sails adorn the ships from Pelletine and Anequina. Few can match the natural grace of the people of Azurah on the masts, and that allows them to operate the rigs of such complexity that would confound the average sailor. The hull of the Anequina's ship is another Mede-period classic - a triple-decked galley, captured together with its home port Leyawiin in the time of troubles. Such warships, although refurbished with modern sailing plans, are still used to patrol the Niben delta by both Potentate and Anequina. The ship of Pelletine is newly-built though, garish with the carved gilded ornaments and bright paint.</p> <p>Freehold is represented by a different vessel at each Regatta, following some complicated internal arrangement between the merchant families. Once they even put out a full Goblin crew, if you can imagine that. This year's contestant comes from the port of Woodhearth, and is a most unique ship. Verdant Verse is a Bosmeri song-carrack, her hull a single living tree, persuaded to take a shape of the ship. The rigging is a mixture of dense broad foliage, canvas, and Altmer sun-sails.</p> <p>Gifted Heart flies the banner of port Evermore. Depending on the complicated ebb and flow of the relationships between the Iliac Bay and their eastern neighbors, it is not always allowed at the Regatta. But the trade up the Bjoulsae is not blockaded by Wayrest now, and the ancient galley of old Breton design is welcomed as an honorable guest.</p> <p>From Blacklight comes Saint Jiub. Her battened silk sails make her appear similar to the Potentate ships from a distance. The hull design, however, marks her as a product of House Sadras. The Resdayn ships only rarely make it as far as the Abecean Sea, mostly being used for local transportation across the Inner Sea, and so their designs are still not fully adapted to the open ocean.</p> <p>The most outlandish-looking is the contestant from Soulrest. From the first impression, an uncharitable observer would call it a giant raft fully assembled of reeds and hollow trunks. But a closer look reveals much cleverness - Eternal Change is a twin-hulled vessel, stable enough for the shore trade, but also able to navigate the swampy shallow rivers and lakes of the southern Black Marsh. The materials are chosen with the traditional Argonian ingenuity to either resist rot naturally, or treated with fire to become such.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Festivals/Potentate.%20Civil%20Servants%20Exams/","title":"Potentate.

The third day of the festival week is the most subdued, for it is when the Potentate mourns the Last Emperor. At this day, not only the shrines of Albertius Mede are full of gifts and pentinents, pilgrimages are made to the shrines of all the worshipped Emperors - the Emperor Zero, Mother Alessia, Reman the Hill-Born, Father Tiber, Martyr Martin that is usually depicted with a dragon breaking out of the ruby embedded in his chest, horned Shezarr and eagle-headed Auriel.

Hello?'</p> <p>Silence.</p> <p>\"Can you hear me?\"</p> <p>A Breton soldeir shoves the Altmer aside.</p> <p>\"Let me handle this, Elf, it just needs a little push.\"</p> <p>He puts aside his cheap wine bottle and kicks the Hologram stand. Suddenly, the purple hologram flails around wildly all over the room, and all the men throw themselves backwards in fright.</p> <p>The Altmer quickly attunes himself to continue maintaining the spell, and it turns back on.</p> <p>\"Can you hear us now?\"</p> <p>\"Yes! I can hear you! Can you hear me?\"</p> <p>\"We can hear you, yes! I-\"</p> <p>And then, the Hologram turns off.</p> <p>\"Fuck!\" Says the Altmer, as he turns around and looks at the terrified Breton. \"What have you done?\"</p> <p>\"Well, it worked for a moment, d-didn't it?\" Says the cowed Breton</p> <p>\"And then it broke! Now my spell isn't even working!\"</p> <p>\"It's not my fault that you failed college.\"</p> <p>A fight breaks out.</p> <p>On the other end, a Colovian sips from his tankard.</p> <p>\"Huh. Are you recording all this, Alessander?\"</p> <p>He sits back down.</p> <p>\"Of course I am.\" I said as I dipped my quill in ink once again \"This is potentially groundbreaking.\"</p> <p>\"Well, Assistant Magistrate,\" Says the Colovian \"If you find an Elf, grown even for his race if I may, failing to cast a spell 'groundbreaking', then I don't share your optimism.\" He breathed and continued \"Before I go back to Cheydinhal, ask the Chaplin to keep working on it. It's a rare day when we find functioning Ayleid spells, and though I doubt we'll ever find the complete version of this spell, or that we, us poor fellow soldiers of St. Alessia will finish what the Ayleids didn't, it's better than doing nothing.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I replied \"However, recall the records of long-distance communications we have already recovered in the newly uncovered parts of Vilverin during the last secret incursion. We know it existed, at least.\"</p> <p>The Colovian turned and said, \"Once again. We're not the Ayleids.\"</p> <p>\"Don't be so modest.\" I said, \"We have Herself on our side.\"</p> <p>The Colovian got up \"It is time for me to go.\"</p> <p>\"Very well.\" I rose, \"Let us pray.\"</p> <p>As he was the senior, he led the prayer, starting with the Admission of Mortality</p> <p>\"By the grace of the covenant, I turn to those superior. May you deem it fit to send us bounties fruitful, and may our transgressions not pierce your domains. For we are mortals, and you are not, and when we die, you remain.\" He then continued with the Alessian Creed. \"O' Blessed St. Alessia, El-Estia, Queen-ut-Cyrod, pray for us slaving mortals and sinners as you prayed for your people's liberty and as Akatosh delivered. For we will eternally honor her covenant, Ae'malatu.\"</p> <p>He got up. \"Are you writing this down too?\"</p> <p>\"Why, yes of course.\" I replied \"For protocol. Also, I will tell the Chaplain of your request, though I am sure this will be continued to be studied for eons.\"</p> <p>\"...Okay. I'm going now. Farewell.\" He said, backing away towards the door.</p> <p>\"Have a safe journey back to Cheydinhal, Inspector. I am sorry we disappointed with the research regarding the Ayleid spell.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, thank you.\"</p> <p>\"May her covenant sow your path.\"</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Literal%20Literature/Esteemed%20Seats%20of%20the%20Elder%20Council/","title":"Esteemed Seats of the Elder Council","text":"<p>\u201cAshes have little care for the destruction they postlude.\u201d</p> <p>There was a hush amongst the Elder Council. It spread lazily, from one head to another, like a heavy fragrance. It took Tiv\u00eara a moment to understand, a junior councilor as she was.</p> <p>Q\u00faint Q\u00faaest, who had spoken, was a member of the Eastern Compatriots\u2019 Assembly. Behind his faction\u2019s arc of the assembly table was a large portrait of Longinus Libro, the first potentate. It was because of this affiliation that his opening line revealed a double meaning. By ashes he had meant an ashen skin tone, (or so Tiv\u00eara deduced) and by that identifier he could have only mean the Wolf-Guar himself: Hlaalu Helseth.</p> <p>The Old Potentate watched carefully. The bags under his eyes had become so dark they were like carved grooves. He sat at the opposite end of the table from Q\u00faint, flanked by members of the Commerce Group (the Hlaalu sect specifically).</p> <p>Small forks of lightning rippled through the starry sky that hung between them. The table below rippled like water.</p> <p>\u201cTo wage war is to engage in struggle,\u201d Q\u00faint continued. \u201cTo believe that war is struggle against our enemy alone is naive, and at times even foolish.\u201d He spoke in a grave way, his long beard wobbling with each word, like a stalactite of foam. \u201cCan any amongst this honourable gathering list the four principal rights of Longinus Libro Thought?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe right to peace,\u201d Helseth replied, his voice a growling warble, aged and throaty. A jellyfish Daedra gently bobbed up through the air next to him, its feelers briefly tangling around the arm that supported his head.</p> <p>\u201cPeace! Peace\u2014how can this Council abide by the Regent Congresses if it fails to uphold peace?\u201d</p> <p>Helseth hoisted the corner of his lip into his cheek, revealing a long tooth. \u201cWar is not the anathema of peace.\u201d There was whispering as he gestured to the portrait of Longinus Libro. \u201cI made his acquaintance in 221; do you know that date?\u201d</p> <p>There were scowls amongst the Eastern Compatriots\u2019 Assembly. Their frustration caused knots of pale fires to ignite in the air. Amongst the factions there were none more dedicated to Longinus Libro Thought than they, though few standing councillors could claim\u2014like Helseth\u2014to have been one of his confidantes.</p> <p>Eventually, one of the Guild Masters' Society spoke up: \u201cThe Southern Undertaking.\u201d</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara took a moment to understand why. Within the Council, there was no such thing as an honest act. The guild master, she realised, was that of the Cooks Guild. Tiv\u00eara had been personally involved in the recent audit of Cropsford by Census and Excise, and in particular had investigated the buy-up of land by a limited liability company. That company\u2019s shareholders included many associates of the Cooks Guild itself. Tiv\u00eara decided to herself that the organisation was aiming to curry favour with Helseth. Why? The powers of the potentate were ultimately limited by the Elder Council\u2019s opposition factions: the Eastern Compatriots\u2019 Assembly, the Cyrodiil Society, the Bruma Committee et al. This made it almost impossible for him to levy many policies.</p> <p>Except, of course, in times of war. One of the articles of the Second Regent Congress allowed the potentate to levy taxes, duties, and tariffs during wartime. If the Leyawiin Commitee\u2019s lobbying for war did succeed then Helseth could implement protectionist trade policies to eliminate competition for agricultural goods in Nibenay, driving up profits.</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara hummed. Maybe the Hlaalu were in on it too. The increased output in Cropsford meant increased economic throughput: more labour, more seeds, and\u2014most importantly\u2014more ash fertiliser, one of the Hlaalu\u2019s big exports. Politics and economics, Tiv\u00eara decided, were studies in the movements of atoms: the analyses of cause, effect, and dependent origination.</p> <p>\u201cLonginus Libro\u2019s second principle right is that to good government,\u201d Helseth continued, \u201cand good government must select the correct policy for the correct situation. For as long as Leyawiin is outside our control we cannot guarantee the movement of goods through the Niben, and for as long as our economy and security are outside of our control we cannot say there exists the state of \u2018peace\u2019, merely a condominium of anxiety and inevitable ruin. When me and Longinus embarked on the Southern Undertaking, we drew swords in the name of peace. The dislodging of the Bravil Clique was the victory of a peace in long terms, not short. Reclaiming Leyawiin shall be in a peace in terms that has no due date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKill meee,\u201d a councillor whispered, just next to Tiv\u00eara. Like her, he was unassociated with any faction, probably a recent hereditary ascendant to the Council.</p> <p>She summoned a folded paper note into her palm, an ease of lucid dreaming, then pushed it into his thigh. He startled a little, but gingerly received it into his hands. All the estimations had been made; this was merely the correct cause for the desired effect, one atom bumping into another.</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara returned her attention to the council. At some point the sky had become a flock of Daedra shaped like whales, their bellies a great white sea hung facewise to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cBah!\u201d Q\u00faint replied. \u201cWe have sieged Leyawiin more times than the tide has come in! What will make this particular bloodbath different?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe shall have the Argonians.\u201d</p> <p>There was disquiet within the hallowed assembly. Argonian warriors enjoyed great fame in the Potentate due to their exploits in the nation\u2019s state-building. Without Orpedes Skote, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Potentate at all, and everyone knew marsh experts like him would be needed in a battle for the Trans-Niben.</p> <p>\u201cA band of mercenaries won\u2019t provide what the New Model Legions already does.\u201d</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara sank into her seat. The NML was by far the greatest fighting force in Tamriel, but the officer corps was staffed in a near perfect 1:1 of actual military men to civilian advisors. The civilian half was commissioned to ensure all military actions complied with the wishes of the Elder Council, and often with Longinus Libro-Helseth Thought specifically.</p> <p>That made the NML clumsy and naive. At times embarrassing.</p> <p>\u201cNo mercenaries. I have secured an alliance with Argonia itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey would never with a Moriche.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they would with a Niben.\u201d</p> <p>Q\u00faint bit his lips. The ECA had a strict and legalistic approach to the articles of the Regent Congresses. One particular article of the Fourth Regent Congress stipulated that any citizen of the Potentate was a Niben. It was impossible for Q\u00faint to argue now without appearing hypocritical.</p> <p>\u201cCompatriots!\u201d he began. A change in tactics? \u201cThe funeral bell of empires is the rattling of sabres, and it is the death of our children, the sharpening of our ploughs, the erosion of our virtue!\u201d An appeal to emotion? So soon? Tiv\u00eara looked to the mass of viridian tentacles that hovered behind the council speaker and her elevated seat. It held a clock in its grasp, which approached the hour. The ECA had opted to speak last for the sake of impact, but that had left them too little time. More and they might have bested Helseth in law and constitutionalism.</p> <p>\u201cBut for us there is a war beyond war: A destiny above destiny. It is the opening of the sky; it is the stretch of the earth. It is our homeland under heaven, one made to engulf the other. It is here the dark shines like day; it is here the night has long begun. Still, my comrades, in the east there sleeps the wide disc of the sun.\u201d Q\u00faint coughed in his old age. \u201cAnd remember, the fragrant one lacks judgement still.\u201d</p> <p>(A pithy proverb, Tiv\u00eara thought; Helseth did have a penchant for Telvanni bugmusk.)</p> <p>\u201cThe votes will now begin,\u201d announced the council speaker. Tiv\u00eara\u2019s eyes flicked to the Commerce Group. Some nodded back, then she reached over to the bored councillor next to her and squeezed his hand. The tentacle Daedra moved above, reaching out its tentacles, attaching a toothy sucker to the front of everyone\u2019s forehead.</p> <p>There were a few slimy moments as it extracted the vote from everyone\u2019s head, then a deep voice: \u201cHmm, yes, I seeeeee,\u201d it echoed. \u201cMy! There are 36 nays to 35 ayes, and 10 absent; the nays will have it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe nays have it!\u201d the speaker repeated. \u201cThere will be no war in the Trans-Niben.\u201d</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara sighed in relief.</p> <p>The various ceremonies of a finished session began. At their end, the dream was extinguished. Tiv\u00eara awoke with a start, coughing up mucus and some fluid that must have come from her lungs. She reached for the iced tea sat on the night table, silk sheets falling down her body. She took a few sips. It tasted like apricots. Just across her room, the curtains softly blew, and beyond them the city of Bravil bristled with life. Tiv\u00eara shakily stood and wobbled over.</p> <p>Curving streets, rock ponds, lacquered surfaces: Bravil was a city increasingly built on visions of beauty that were asymmetrical, naturalist and sought after a certain type of \u2018just so\u2019 exuberance. Balconies scaled up over the water in a precarious stacking of homes, building up to sloped rooves. Skiffs sailed up against frigates and junks as they slid into the docks. It was there that the Nibenese All-Union of Guilds were organising from inside a pagoda.</p> <p>Tivera narrowed her eyes. Were they agitating for strike action?</p> <p>Other countries were lucky enough to not really have guilds: Their artisan groups were being slowly outproduced by Iliac modes of production that didn\u2019t rely on artisanal knowledge and expertise, except\u2014of course\u2014in the Potentate. Here, they had invested their guild dues as capital to purchase the new means of production, reaping profits according to those dues. Despite that privilege, they continued to abuse their effect over the economy to bully the EEC and other groups into providing preferential treatment.</p> <p>Tiv\u00eara scoffed. She made a note to have the house guards show them her own form of strike action. As well, she reminded herself to find the name of the councillor she had bribed, including arranging a transfer of EEC stock to him. Its value would have plummeted if the Potentate had gone to war with Leyawiin, since the Company enjoyed exclusive extraterritoriality through the Trans-Niben, as well as a treaty district in the city. War could risk these economic privileges, and victory could mean they were no longer exclusive. Although it had been essential that the mobilisation decree failed in the Elder Council, it was also essential that EEC representatives in the Commerce Group were not seen publicly voting against it. That\u2019s why nominal independents like her were important; otherwise the EEC risked its place in Helseth\u2019s Camarilla.</p> <p>In the distance, dragon banners flew through the air like streaks of blood, casting shadows under the light of the breaking dawn. Across them were the inerrant words of the Potentate, written in bright gold:</p> <p>LONGINUS IS YOUNG AGAIN</p> <p>THERE IS NO WARRIOR BUT ORPEDES</p> <p>NIBENAY STANDS ALONE HEROICALLY IN THE UNIVERSE</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Literal%20Literature/Report.%20The%20Persistence%20of%20Dreams%20%28Norvulk%29/","title":"Report. The Persistence of Dreams (Norvulk)","text":"<p>Knight of the Golden Staff   Lead Researcher, Daedric Influences and Incursions Branch   Advisor on Restorative and Curative Procedures   Welkynd Technical Research Laboratory Monitor   Wayrest Mages House </p> <p>It is, perhaps, surprising that so many studies have continued to dive into the old, musty, and often dangerous ruins that dot our landscape. In the centuries that have passed, we have found new ways to access what has been left behind. The ruins that have flooded are among the best for the practice of Eiditic Hydrogeomantic Illusionary Chrono-Alterations. While they are rather expensive to fund research into, as the mercenary adventurer class of knights has several surcharges around injury, dismemberment, and drowning, we learn more from watching these proceedings than scouring any library. The methods came to us via Ciphers in Apocrypha, yet there had been no adverse effects noted from the use of the techniques, aside from the aforementioned drowning.</p> <p>The last team that we sent into the field found that a passage had been opened in Norvulk Ruins. The stones of a wall had been dislodged by a sinkhole revealing that there had been more than one level to this ruin. While there was the loss of 2 mercenaries and a researcher to the movement of debris and a second researcher to drowning from the spring that opened into the ruin, their lives were not given without the advancement of knowledge from this uncovered location. The remaining members of the team had been able to secure several smaller artifacts back to Wayrest after running initial EHICA scans. From the artifacts and subsequent investigations, it is requested and urgent that we conduct more dream-shielding studies in nearby Wind Keep.</p> <p>Further Investigations: From previous studies and tomes from ages past, we have known Vaermina cults to have been active in Stormhaven. Some smaller cults have sought only small scale power or revenge. Larger cults have had a remake of Nirn via Quagmire in their itinerary. Decayed inventory lists from previous eras include potions to disrupt sleep patterns so that dreams do not occur at all, provided by an Azura following. </p> <p>Note: Studies from the Alchemical Branch on a non-Daedric variant have indicated that long-term usage is not recommended, but not always avoidable. The Wayrest Library of Arcane Studies contains observations of those effects on those housed within the Daedric Influences Isolation Ward. Visual hallucinations of butterflies or star patterns and auditory whispers reported. (See Advisory on Dream-Blockage Compounded Elixir for further details.) </p> <p>The initial EHICA scans within Norvulk showed more extensive offerings to Vaermina and gave a suggestion for where statuary may have been present. Secondary scans were conducted a week later by the containment team, which suggested that deeper scans to determine the nature of the rituals was necessary. I attended this ruin with the tertiary team, after the ruin was deemed secured and contained. The waters from the spring that ran into this lower level of the ruin were cool and clear on entry. There was the slightest hint of lavender and chamomile in the air, unlike the dusty stale air in the upper floor, with its perfume of mildew. As the sailors might note - the calm before the storm.</p> <p>I set up the braziers and stones used for the extensive EHICA studies. With the use of both welkynd and culanda stones, the shades that appeared had a pale sea green color. The Ciphers have assured me that we are not causing a rift with Apocrypha, despite the color tone that is often present. As a precaution, I had other researchers monitoring the site for any new activity or breeches. A precaution that was valuable to this study. </p> <p>We were witness to the shades conducting their own rituals. As they were not distinct enough, we could not be certain of the races of the beings brought in to the chamber. Humanoid slaves, to be certain, based on the method that they were escorted into the chamber and the screams that followed. Height for those escorted in was on par with average Breton subjects. No tails were noted. </p> <p>It is not often that the visions given by EHICA procedures include sensory information beyond visual. (Confirmation from the Ciphers on the nature of these occurrences pending.) In this case, the auditory components were clearer than the visuals. The screams came often. The range of tones indicated that there was no specific exclusion to a singular gender or age group. Despite the accenting of the words being unusual to our ears, we could make out calls for mercy. Those calls went unanswered. In the breaks from the screams, there were wails and sobbing.</p> <p>The other researchers present also confirmed that the scent in the room changed. The undertone of lavender was overrun with the smells of wood smoke and something akin to licorice. Possibly a method to calm those that were brought in, despite the screams. It is unclear if it worked on those we witnessed. After study surveys yielded that it did not calm any of the team present. </p> <p>The vision shifted at this point. We watched as an overlay of the ruin moved on to the next chamber. The screams were louder, though the vision was still very hazy and indistinct. From what we could see, it appeared to be rows of cages in the room. Mats or hay beds, perhaps, were within those cages. No torture implements were noted. The vision entered one of those cages. A meal of some variety was provided; again the vision was not clear enough to make out the details. </p> <p>When the vision did start to resolve into something clear, we were no longer viewing the inside of Norvulk. We watched as towers grew impossibly high, catch fire, topple, and then take on new shapes. The screams shifted into a chorus. Not a joyous one, such as occurs at the Temple to the Divines. </p> <p>\u201cMara preserve us,\u201d I heard one of our guard mutter, \u201cthat stench is worse than the Wayrest Sewers in Sun\u2019s Height.\u201d One of the researchers must have agreed, based on the sounds he was making at the far corner of the room. I will not attempt to describe the scent we were assaulted with, but it was quite unpleasant.</p> <p>Colors started to encroach on the pale green. First darker greens and purples, then blackish shadows. As more towers grew, there were lights in the openings. Some fires were reddish, while others pale blue. The towers began to shift in style as Ayleid architecture gave way to Altmer and then to castles erected in Daggerfall and Wayrest. Explosions rocked both castles, which tumbled into masses of stone, before the stones shifted to create what appeared to be the Great Arch on which Solitude is built. A great fire ravaged across the top of the Arch before the scene changed again. The fires grew and, in the now red landscape, giant trees loomed overhead and threatened to drop fiery branches everywhere. </p> <p>The researchers at the far end of the chamber called out that their secondary scans were beginning to pick up activity. This EHICA deep-scan procedure was thus ended and the braziers were dampened. Even as we removed the various stones from their holders, our guards noted that the shadows still appeared to have movement of their own. </p> <p>The vision was surely Quagmire. In accessing the eras old memory, we had drawn the attention of those in the present, for the veil was easily pierced to that realm. We have put up several barriers and warning sigils on the ruin. Additional teams have been dispatched to monitor the area, including Wind Keep, for nightmare incursions. Alchemical teams have been tasked with producing elixirs similar to what we have in the archives for dream-state reduction. Residents of Wind Keep will be offered them at a subsidized rate from the Wayrest Mages House for a time, until we are sure that the threat has been properly contained.</p> <p>Current Threat Assessment: High risk of Incursion from Quagmire. Heightened risk of Vaermina cult activity. Moderate risk of Sanguine cult activity, as nightmares increase tavern activity. Low risk of other Daedric activity.  Recommendations:  Monitor Menevia area, including Wind Keep, for problems with sleep and nightmares. Monitor taverns in the same locations for excessive drinking.  Level 4 containment shielding on Norvulk Ruin to deter treasure hunters, bandits, and cult activity.  Prepare isolation ward for an increase in population.  Increase production of dream inhibiting potions.

Good luck figuring out what the hell even happened in the game.] </p> <p>'Who walks there, dreary in the night?', said the noble blood-sucker. 'Who walks there, seeking their life!', said the gold-skinned Altmer. 'We!', was the shout.   </p> <p>Around the round table they sit, so empty yet quiet. The Mer and the Vampire, not sure who's the pilot. The Party of Seven approaches, their mission awaits. Their minds are so damaged, they cannot weight the weights. 'Ye heroes! Your memories may be lost, however, render unto the reward we so seek. For if our quarry grasps it before me, collective ruin I foresee!'.  However, the elf shouts 'but deliver it not to the Vampire, for his worship of the Sower of Strife foreshadows a greater will of domination towards thine poor race'. And yet the Vampire shouts also, 'deliver it unto me, brave armigers, for the Elf is the enemy of our realm, who spits naught but lies, the seed of division and doubt!'.  And they say 'But oh, ye aimless walkers, let us give you aim and arm. Take our coin, shop and cram. Equip yourselves for servitude!' </p> <p>The Party of Seven departs. They rack their brains, yet no memories can be found. Stories of grandeur, adventures of old, they are lost! To the pit of passions long gone, they are whisked away. But who has taken their life? Who made them shells of their person? For if one lacks their memory of their own person, is one the same person?  </p> <p>The thought gnaws at them at the ancient ruin of the last of the Elves become Undead. Follies they commit on the road, innocents they savage, their brains ravaged, given aimless aim and aimless arms.  At the ruin they collect, the prized reward they get. To the tower of Kings they head, by which their insanity is beset.  'It is your prize we carry!', shout the Party of Seven, 'Now let us out, for in this endless dream we tarry'.

'Who are you, so mad yet unknown, to massacre your betters?' 'We are the beaten and restless, we are tired of oppressors'  On the gallows they say 'We regret nothing, and so we will die!'. Their madness has taken them, no fault of their own- for their fate was weaved by those greater than their own. </p> <p>And so it for the rest of the days- the chairs were replaced, their seats stuffed with hays. The people kept walking, their heads kneeling down, in the memory of the Seven, who fought 'til the dawn. For a day in the year, Seven Emperors had reigned.

Moragada climbed down off of the rock, wincing as he used his left hand to steady himself; his left shoulder blade had a small piece of brass embedded in it.</p> <p>\u201cBoth of them.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at Stithulf.</p> <p>\u201cThere were only two of them.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked back at him, frowning.</p> <p>\u201cThere were only two\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Moragada walked over to the deceased Dunmer who had hired them to protect him. Grunting, he kicked the body over, flipping it face up. The Redoran noble\u2019s extravagant robes were covered in blood and soot, and ripped down the middle. So was his torso.  \u201cWe\u2019ll get the other one next time.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked at his companion, nodded grimly, and sighed. </p> <p>\u201cRight. Next time.\u201d</p> <p>The two began again to loot the bodies. </p> <p>Stithulf looked at the assassin thoughtfully. </p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the Tong.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada grunted over his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>He was prying their former employer\u2019s moonstone dagger off of his hip. Stithulf searched the assassin\u2019s pockets, and then the folds of their tunic. They wore a thick black cloth bodysuit; enough to protect against small arms, but still almost as light as regular clothing. Probably enchanted, Stithulf noticed. He also noticed their weapon: an ebony dagger, engraved with images of skulls and snakes. He whistled, then yelled back to Moragada.</p> <p>\u201cThey may not have been the Tong, but these were no run-of-the-mill raiders, either.\u201d</p> <p>He reached into the layers of the assassin\u2019s collar and found a small, folded piece of paper. He unfolded it and began to read.</p> <p>As his eyes scanned the letter, his brow furrowed, and a look of concern formed across his face.</p> <p>\u201cMolag\u2019s balls...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>Moragada had walked up behind Stithulf, and was reading the strange note over his shoulder. He scowled as he did so.</p> <p>\u201cThis makes no sense\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Both stood and looked at what they knew was a hit contract, specifying the target to be eliminated: Sehr Dernas, councilor of House Redoran. But what they were focused on was the sign-off on the bottom of the page:</p> <p>\u201cThis deed shall be done, in the name and service of Sithis. Thus commands The Night Mother.\u201d</p> <pre><code>                   **TWO DAYS EARLIER**\n</code></pre> <p>\u201cSo? I won\u2019t ask again; there are other sellswords in Blacklight. A surplus, actually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why seek us out?\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked at his friend worriedly. Sometimes he wondered if Moragada actually wanted to find jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a saying in Snow-Throat, Mor: don\u2019t look a friendly Dovah in the mouth.\u201d</p> <p>The Nord and his Orc companion sat at a back table at a cornerclub, across from House Redoran councilor Sehr Dernas, who was flanked by two members of his personal guard. The small-statured Dunmer pursed his lips.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. Your friend is right.\u201d</p> <p>The councilor sighed.</p> <p>\u201cI need someone a bit\u2026 let\u2019s say \u2018unconventional\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada remained stone-faced, but there was annoyance in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cDo elaborate on how and why that\u2019s not an insult.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas let out a short, sharp laugh - a shrill sound that was stifled as quickly as it had emerged. He leaned on the table towards the two mercenaries, and lowered his voice.</p> <p>\u201cThere are hundreds of sellswords in Resdayn that I could hire for protection. Mephala\u2019s sake, I have my own personal guard! But\u2026\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair again.</p> <p>\u201cYour reputation precedes you. You two have been all over. Taken on all manner of beast and brigand. And I\u2019m traveling to somewhat uncharted territory.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled wistfully.</p> <p>\u201cBleakrock Isle.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada looked at Stithulf, who shrugged. Then he looked back to the councilor.</p> <p>\u201cNever heard of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. It was razed by pyromancers long ago - 2nd Era, actually - and then again during the Second Great War, by Aldmeri troops who discovered an outpost of Snow-Throat militia had made camp there. It was never repopulated; it hasn\u2019t even been labeled on maps since the end of the war.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf raised an eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cSo why go at all?\u201d</p> <p>Dernas\u2019 smile erupted into a full-on grin.</p> <p>\u201cThey say Falmer used to live there - back when they were civilized. I\u2019m a bit of an\u2026 amateur enthusiast of their culture.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada snorted.</p> <p>\u201cSo why would you need protection to go to an abandoned island? Sounds like nothing too dangerous. Unless you\u2019re afraid of some\u2026 exotic wildlife?\u201d</p> <p>The Orc smirked as he said the last two words, a barely discernible tug at the corner of his mouth. Dernas stared at him, unamused.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing inhabiting the isle. But the terrain is unfamiliar. And there may be some trouble on the journey there and back. You see, I\u2019ve recently\u2026 well let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve offended the Temple of Reclamations\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2026and they\u2019ve sent their legally sanctioned assassins after you,\u201d Stithulf finished. </p> <p>\u201cThe Morag Tong.\u201d</p> <p>The Nord smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI hear they\u2019re quite good at what they do.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas frowned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to reconsider my proposition.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada leaned in.</p> <p>\u201cTo the point: you need escorts who are used to traveling in unusual terrain, and who are brave or foolish enough to take on the Tong.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas nodded.</p> <p>\u201cMore or less. I can travel through Blacklight without issue, but once we\u2019re off-shore, my protections will be considerably less robust. On the island, even less so. Given, the likelihood of them following me to the isle is fairly slim; my primary concern is the distance between.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll attack you at sea? I didn\u2019t that that was their forte.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas looked at Stithulf flatly.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The councilor sighed, and motioned for his guards to leave the club ahead of him. He rubbed his temples.</p> <p>\u201cI am a wanted man. The Morag Tong will come after me; you can count on that. I am leaving for Bleakrock Isle, today, and I am taking either you two, or the Reavers waiting outside.\u201d</p> <p>He spread his hands.</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>Moragada and Stithulf looked at each other, and then back at the councilor. The Nord spoke.</p> <p>\u201cCouncilor, you\u2019ve got yourself two\u2026 unconventional bodyguards.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas looked at his new protectors.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <pre><code>                                      ***\n</code></pre> <p>The group sailed in the councilor\u2019s ship: a bug-shell vessel designed, as most high quality ships from Resdayn were, by House Sadras, with their signature chitin hull and silk sails. The journey to the shore had been uneventful, with nothing hindering them other than a couple of wild Nix-Hounds. Moragada sat on the deck meditating, his sword in his lap. Stithulf cleaned and aligned his crossbow, and took inventory of his various alchemically engineered bolts. Dernas sat in his quarters, with two bonemold-clad guards stationed outside - the same two from the club, Stith realized. Probably his elite guardsmen.</p> <p>Moragada sighed in frustration and opened his eyes. He\u2019d had his concentration broken\u2026 again. The same distraction as last time. </p> <p>\u201cDamn that machine!\u201d</p> <p>He was speaking of the councilor\u2019s Dwarven automaton, a sphere centurion. It turned out that having an interest in Falmer culture somewhat necessitated an interest in the Dwemer as well, and Dernas had recently acquired his oversized toy from a Dwemer goods vendor in Snow-Throat. It now rolled about the deck, performing a patrol routine, steam hissing and gears clanking all the while. Moragada finally gave up on his meditation, and walked over and sat on a crate across from Stithulf.</p> <p>\u201cWhy hire us if he\u2019s going to bring his brass bodyguard?\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf regarded the machine briefly, and then returned his attention to his work.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more of a novelty than anything; assuming it\u2019s authentic, that thing is hundreds of years old.\u201d</p> <p>Mor glared at the novelty.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say the same, if he didn\u2019t make such a big fuss about it. \u2018Faster and more effective than any man or mer.\u2019 Hmph.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada pulled a cloth from his satchel, and began cleaning his sword. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see it trade blows with you or I.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf smiled.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like he\u2019s been listening to those fast-talking junk peddlers from Snow-Throat. They could sell you scrap metal and have you convinced it was a piece of the Numidium.\u201d</p> <p>As the pair sat and talked, one of Dernas\u2019 men approached them.</p> <p>\u201cYou two. The councilor wants to see you.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada stood.</p> <p>\u201cGood. I can ask him about shutting that thing off.\u201d</p> <p>The guard only glared at the Orc in response as he walked away. </p> <p>As the mercenaries entered his cabin, Dernas folded a map he was reading, placing it in a drawer in his desk. </p> <p>\u201cGentlemer. Thank you for obliging me.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada looked around the room, noticing the various pieces of Dwemer and Falmer weaponry hanging on the walls. Dernas traced his gaze.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like them? They\u2019re some of the finest in my collection.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada focused on one in particular: a moonstone spear. It was masterfully crafted; graceful curving lines, feathered motifs on the spearhead, and, he noticed, a bit of gold etching on the shaft. Prayers for blessings in battle.</p> <p>Dernas smiled.</p> <p>\u201cThat one is a particularly beautiful piece. A Falmeri spear, late Merethic, probably used-\u201c</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas let out his short, shrill laugh again, but a look of disgust painted his face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada pointed at the spearhead.</p> <p>\u201cSee the feather detail? This is Altmeri. Falmer saw Auri-El as the god of the sun, and their crafting motifs reflected that. And this gold here, on the shaft; it\u2019s Falmer writing, but they wouldn\u2019t have used gold. They favored Ebony for prayer etching, especially on Solstheim, which is where I\u2019m assuming you bought this from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas\u2019 look of disgust had contorted into a scowl, but Mor either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care, and kept talking.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed. Altmeri, early Fourth Era; probably used in the First Great War. The etchings were added later, to make it appear Falmeri. A common trick.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf would have laughed, had it not been for the fact that their employer looked ready to grab the counterfeit spear off of the wall and run Moragada through with it. Not that he could, but he looked ready to try.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a replacement on Bleakrock, councilor. If your sources are correct, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas sniffed, and regained his composure.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well. I didn\u2019t summon you here to evaluate my collection. I have some news.\u201d</p> <p>He took a Dwemer puzzle cube out of his desk and began to fiddle with it. Stithulf noticed that the councilor didn\u2019t seem to have the slightest idea how to even begin solving the actual puzzle.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems my friends in the Temple have forgiven me. I received word via courier just before we cast off.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada glared at Dernas.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>Dernas smiled.</p> <p>\u201cIt means that the Morag Tong won\u2019t be troubling us on this voyage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. An easy job, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas finally got a piece of the puzzle cube to move, and fidgeted with it absentmindedly, repeating the same movement and getting nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, it will be so easy that I wanted to inform you that I\u2019ll be cutting your pay in half.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada stepped forward, placing his hands on the councilor\u2019s desk.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you tell us this now?\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf joined his friend in front of the desk, the Nord\u2019s imposing figure towering over the seated Dunmer.</p> <p>\u201cYou hired us for a job, councilor. You can\u2019t back out.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas waved his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not reneging on our agreement, I\u2019m simply altering it. Surely you understand. If there\u2019s no danger-\u201c</p> <p>Moragada interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no danger, then you wouldn\u2019t have brought us. You\u2019d have told us this in Blacklight. You have a purpose for keeping us. What is it?\u201d</p> <p>Dernas stopped fiddling with his puzzle and frowned. He looked at Moragada.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026 hm.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed.</p> <p>\u201cFine. I was not\u2026 entirely honest about the island. There have been reports of raiders. Vagabonds, seeking their fortune and settling on the unclaimed land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you thought you could get us to agree to a pay cut, and pretend that the settlers were news to you.\u201d Stithulf replied. He looked at Moragada.</p> <p>\u201cHow much would you wager that the Tong was never after him in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>Moragada stared at the councilor as he replied to Stithulf.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d stake our pay on it.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cThe Morag Tong, attacking at sea. I knew that didn\u2019t sit well.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas\u2019 gaze darted between the two angry sellswords, and he began to stammer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026 well\u2026 l-listen-\u201c</p> <p>Moragada straightened, and grabbed the spear off of the wall. Dernas\u2019 eyes widened in fear.</p> <p>\u201cGuards!\u201d</p> <p>Before the word had left the councilor\u2019s mouth, Moragada had jammed the spear inside the frame of the door, barring it shut. The two guards outside began pounding on the door, yelling to the councilor. Stithulf readied his crossbow, aiming it at the doorway. Moragada approached Dernas, who drew a moonstone dagger from a sheath on his belt.</p> <p>\u201cStay back, beast!\u201d</p> <p>Mor swiftly grabbed the Dunmer\u2019s wrist with his left hand, and pried the dagger from it with his right. He admired it in his hand.</p> <p>\u201cNow this is genuine Falmeri. Beautiful piece.\u201d</p> <p>He dropped it, and grabbed the collar of Dernas\u2019 robe. Stithulf continued to watch the door, which had begun to splinter. </p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry it along, Mor.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada pulled Dernas close.</p> <p>\u201cListen closely, councilor. We were hired to escort you. We are going to escort you. We will be paid to escort you. And we will be paid full price.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas\u2019 face turned from fear to confusion.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2026 you still want the job?\u201d</p> <p>Moragada frowned.</p> <p>\u201cWe are already halfway to Bleakrock Isle. By the time we turned around and sailed back to Resdayn, we would have lost two days\u2019 worth of work.\u201d</p> <p>He let go of the councilor\u2019s robes.</p> <p>\u201cWe will escort you, as agreed.\u201d</p> <p>The door split into two pieces, the spear wedged in the frame the only thing holding it up.</p> <p>\u201cOr, Stithulf could test his exploding bolts on you and your guards.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked back at Dernas and grinned.</p> <p>\u201cDesigned them myself. Always wanted to try them out.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas looked at Moragada, and began to laugh; not the short, restrained one from before, but a prolonged shrieking cackle. </p> <p>\u201cOh, I forgot what fun it is, dealing with mercenaries.\u201d</p> <p>He yelled to his guards.</p> <p>\u201cGuards! It\u2019s alright! Cease your attack!\u201d</p> <p>The guards stopped breaking the door down, and Stithulf lowered his crossbow. Moragada picked up Dernas\u2019 dagger and held it out to him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a deal, then.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas dusted his robes off and straightened himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe do. Full price.\u201d</p> <p>He took his dagger from the Orc, sheathing it. Moragada grunted, and walked to the door. He grabbed the spear and pulled it from the doorframe in one motion, then hung it back on the wall. Dernas\u2019 honor guards watched Moragada and Stithulf as they walked back onto the deck, then rushed inside to check on the councilor. Stithulf chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cWell I suppose this is going to be an easier job now.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cThe Morag Tong\u2026 sailing out to sea to kill some councilor. Ysmir\u2019s beard\u2026\u201d</p> <pre><code>                                      ***\n</code></pre> <p>Dernas had not been lying about the isle; it was utterly scorched, the miles of ash-covered fields only broken by the occasional blackened tree stump. Moragada and Stithulf walked in front of the councilor\u2019s transportation: a Dwemer steam-chariot, which had been loaded in the cargo hold of the ship for the journey. It hissed and creaked, its massive wheels turning slowly as it crawled over the barren land. The steam centurion rolled just ahead of it, its carved face staring blankly forwards. Dernas\u2019 two guards stood inside the chariot on either side of him, brandishing steel-tipped spears. Dernas had smugly addressed the two mercenaries as he\u2019d climbed onto his transport, informing them that there was simply no room for more than three aboard the chariot. \u201cJust as well,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cWe need someone to scout ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada scanned the horizon, noting the distant columns of smoke; no doubt from settlers encampments. The nearest was perhaps ten miles out, and a good distance west from the direction they were traveling in. The side of the isle they had landed on was as-of-yet uninhabited; none of the predominantly wealthy citizens of Blacklight were desperate enough to sail to such barren lands in search of a homestead. By the look of it, the crews journey would be a solitary one. They traveled on what clearly used to be a road, with ditches still lining either side of the path. Their destination, a strip of snow-capped mountains, lay about a day\u2019s journey ahead of them. There was where they may encounter trouble; Falmer were known to live in the mountains, and raiders and treasure hunters would know this.</p> <p>Stithulf suddenly kneeled and raised his hand in a signal for the group to stop. The carriage creaked to a halt, but the automaton kept rolling, moving past Moragada, who gave it a sharp kick.</p> <p>\u201cThat means stop, scrap heap.\u201d</p> <p>Dernas stood and yelled from his chariot.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that again unless you\u2019re willing to pay for that!\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf hissed.</p> <p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d</p> <p>He touched the ground, and then brought his fingers up to sniff.</p> <p>\u201cOil.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at Moragada, whose hand now rested on the handle of his sword.</p> <p>\u201cDwarven oil. But I don\u2019t see any-\u201d</p> <p>Dernas interrupted him.</p> <p>\u201cCan we continue on, please? We have quite a way to go, and I assure you some oil in the road isn\u2019t going to hinder this piece of machinery.\u201d</p> <p>The steam centurion hissed, and then began to roll forward again, obeying its masters words without understanding their context as a question.</p> <p>Moragada looked around, searching for any signs of life. Stump. Rock. Stump. Ash. He sighed in frustration. Nothing moving except for the stupid automaton, which continued rolling slowly down the road. Down the road, where there was nothing but\u2026 Moragada\u2019s eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cStop! Stop you worthless-\u201c</p> <p>WHOOSH</p> <p>Moragada squinted, trying to see through the smoke. He recoiled as flames flared up next to him, licking at his armor. Too slow. There had been a fire rune in the road, barely visible on the blackened ash. The centurion had set it off, and then it had caught the oil trail, setting the chariot ablaze. Stithulf aimed his crossbow, sweeping from left to right, trying to see something, anything through the smoke. Mor drew his sword, looking around for danger and listening for anyone from his group.</p> <p>Suddenly, a scream cut through the smoke and flames; Dernas, somewhere near the chariot still, having by some miracle or divine favor dismounted it before it ignited.</p> <p>\u201cHelp! Orc! Nord! M\u2026 Morada? Stiff wolf? Oh damn it to the Ashpit, just help me!\u201d</p> <p>Moragada began to walk through the smoke towards the councilor\u2019s voice. Stithulf did as well, still circling to look for enemies. The smoke was unnaturally thick; Stithulf realized that the oil must have been alchemically altered to produce more of it when it burned. Whoever set this trap was a professional. </p> <p>Moragada heard movement to his left, and spun around, swinging his sword towards it in a wide arc. A figure had sprung from beneath a pile of ash, lunging towards him. As Mor brought his blade around, the figure ducked beneath it with impossible speed, throwing up ash as they did so. Moragada\u2019s eyes squeezed shut in pain, but he had already begun his next swing by instinct, bringing his sword straight downwards towards his assailant. He felt it glance off of a small blade - a dagger. He felt the arm holding the dagger buckle with the force of the blow, heard a sharp crack. Mor\u2019s eyes cleared, and he looked around, but the figure had vanished into the smoke. Hurt, for sure. Probably a broken arm. But that wouldn\u2019t stop them, he knew. They were too well-trained for that.</p> <p>A scream echoed out - Dernas again. But this time there were no words, only a piercing shriek, followed by a gurgling sound. Stithulf was close, but he knew what the sound meant; he had heard it from many men and mer, but never from a client. It was the sound of life leaving one\u2019s body. Knowing the councilor was lost, he determined to make his killer share his fate. He let bolts fly in the direction of the noise, rapidly firing and reloading; one, two, three. He heard a sharp gasp, and then a muffled thud as two bodies fell to the ground. Then he heard the sound of blades colliding; Moragada had found another of the assassins. Stithulf didn\u2019t dare fire for fear of hitting his friend. The smoke was clearing, but not fast enough.</p> <p>\u201cMor!\u201d</p> <p>Moragada clashed blades with the assassin again. This one had a shortsword, and fared slightly better than the first. He could see them better, too, but that meant they could also see him. They were fast, parrying and dodging his blows with ease. He kept pressure on them, swinging relentlessly and forcing them to stay on the defensive, but he knew he couldn\u2019t keep this up for much longer. He looked around, searching for an out, but saw nothing but\u2026 the automaton. The piece of junk was still functioning, clunking around blindly with half a body. Coming towards him. Moragada turned towards where he\u2019d heard Stithulf yell from, and shouted back.</p> <p>\u201cStith! The automaton!\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked around, and spotted the machine. Moragada\u2019s voice rang out again.</p> <p>\u201cTime to test out your new bolts!\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf understood, and quickly loaded his crossbow with the projectile Moragada had forged based on his design; a hollow-tipped bolt filled with fire salts and coated in dwarven oil. Moragada desperately swung at the assassin, quickly losing steam. His opponent could tell, and was slowly turning the tide, forcing him to adopt a more and more defensive stance. Stithulf yelled to him.</p> <p>\u201cTell me when!\u201d</p> <p>Moragada answered before Stithulf had even finished the question.</p> <p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p> <p>The assassin heard the exchange, and knew something was amiss, but it was too late. Moragada put all of his force into a bash with the side of his blade, and then kicked the assassin backwards, right into the path of the approaching automaton. Moragada dove onto the ground as Stithulf fired his crossbow, and the bolt found its mark. An explosion erupted from the broken centurion, sending pieces of it flying in all directions. Moragada winced as a shard of brass found his shoulder, and Stithulf shielded his eyes from the flash. The assassin Mor had been fighting vanished, without a trace.</p> <pre><code>                                     ***\n</code></pre> <p>Stithulf still stared at the note.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it explains why they were so well-trained.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cBut why were they here? This isn\u2019t Potentate territory. And even if it was, why would Helseth want a Redoran councilor dead?\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf folded the note and tucked it into his shirt.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors - more like scary stories, really - of Dark Brotherhood cells that operate outside of Helseth\u2019s control, functioning the old way: taking contracts from whoever is willing to pay, and answering to matriarchs that preside over certain regions.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf held out the assassin\u2019s dagger to Mor, who took it and examined it closely.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like the scary stories were true. This is a ceremonial dagger. These etchings are meant to dedicate its victims to Sithis.\u201d</p> <p>He scoffed and handed the dagger back to Stithulf.</p> <p>\u201cThe Brotherhood never was fond of subtlety.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf stood and dusted the ash off of himself.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what do we do now?\u201d</p> <p>Moragada bent down and used the councilor\u2019s dagger to cut a piece of his robe off, wrapping it around his shoulder like a bandage.</p> <p>\u201cNow we return to the ship, tell the crew what happened, and sail back to Blacklight. Then we take our reward from the councilor\u2019s collection. I\u2019m sure there are enough authentic pieces to equal out to our pay.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf looked thoughtfully at the destroyed automaton for a moment, and then began unloading the Dwemer bolts from its crossbow. He chuckled mirthlessly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never botched up a job this badly before.\u201d</p> <p>Mor stood looking at the dead councilor.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Stithulf stood and walked over to his friend, standing beside him. He placed his hand on the Orc\u2019s shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get them all\u2026 next time.\u201d</p> <p>Moragada stared grimly at the only contract they had ever failed.</p> <p>\u201cNext time\u2026\u201d</p> <pre><code>                                 **END**\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Literal%20Literature/The%20War%20of%20The%20Two%20Emperors/","title":"The War of The Two Emperors","text":"<p>by Anonymous via Orsinium Northside Publishing House</p> <p>This is the White-Gold Tower Guard Battalion's recreation of events leading to the recent spread of \"The War of the Two Emperors\" pamphlet spread around Tamriel, recently declared contraband in the Potentate, formed from various testimonies.</p> <p>It is nighttime in the Topal Bay.

The Old Dragon savored his victory, as later we who survived the punishment could see from our tall battlements his parade and coronation as Emperor of Akavir. Fashioning himself a new crown from Akaviri jade, gold and the never before seen crystals of the East Coast, we watched him as his Snakeman knights and consorts and many offsprings carried his frail lich-like body towards the floating seat of the Iridescent and Imperial.

Riften, several times. First as a boy with his friends, stealing away on riverboats to cross Lake Honrich and trawl the canals and docks, then as a militiaman, sailing in on those same riverboats, above deck this time. Ivarstead, to wonder at the amphitheater of the Great Moot and the barely-visible monasteries upon the holy slopes of the Throat. Eastmarch, city of skalds, city of cold stone and warm candles, passing through the docks again and again, to and from the north coast in the Years of White Summers. And now Winterhold.</p> <p>Winterhold. No city like it, the sailors said. No port like it, the sailors said. No, not even Dawnstar, nor Solitude, nor any of the Wrothgarian cities to the west, was like this city. Nor the Resdayni cities of the east, though the Ahhemusa of Sheogorad might have some similar. No, the sailors said, Winterhold was a singular city.</p> <p>It was a damned cold city, is what it was, Stithulf thought.</p> <p>The roadway he stood by switched back and forth as it climbed from the Port of New Winterhold to the College of Old Winterhold, granting him a view of the port and the sea beyond. The sea was grey and white, the color of dark slate, pocked by squalls of rain and floating ice. Far off, the sky and sea met, grey meeting grey.</p> <p>Somewhere off in that grey lay Atmora, land of the midnight sun, land of frozen bearded kings. Or not, from the reports he\u2019d read and stories the expeditionaries told. A land of tundra and glaciers, ruins of Atmora of old slumbering beneath snow and ice. Atmora.</p> <p>Magnar called to him from Atmora, and he answered. A land to search out, to wander, to dig in and scout out.</p> <p>The sound of a bell ringing brought his attention back to the Port. Below, a ship was making its way to the docks, oars sweeping through the water. An assortment of dockmen had gathered, making ready to throw out ropes to bring the ship in and tie her to the dock, joining the dozens-odd ships already moored inside the seawall. In the ship\u2019s wake a sea-chariot raced, harnessed horkers drawing the small craft to a beach to the east of the docks. Two women stood in the chariot, bleached white hair whipping in the wind. Fryse hags, most likely, in from one of the watchtowers along the coast. The chariot passed the ship, and Stithulf could make out shouted greetings from both the crew and dockhands. Mutual respect. Earned, not demanded.</p> <p>Nid thur nunon zul. No lordship but voice.</p> <p>Stithulf\u2019s eyes wandered the port itself. No city like it indeed. The buildings of the Port were long and low, resembling ship\u2019s hulls overturned. From what he understood, the earliest buildings had been overturned ships, beached on the shore during the Plague. The design had stuck, and been improved on. Rounded roofs, blunted or flat ends, thick stone walls, wooden slat floors with pits beneath to let cold air collect in - dim interiors, to be sure, but warm, even in the chill of the Sea. From this high on the path, all the buildings looked small, but he had walked the plank streets himself. The largest could fit a giant comfortably, to say nothing of the warehouses and drydocks that could swallow ships easily.</p> <p>The Port of New Winterhold. No city like it, indeed.</p> <p>A gust of wind whipped at Stithulf, bringing the promise of cold late spring rain. Stithulf shivered in the damp cold, turning from the view back to the road. Balls of magelight were beginning to spring up from the cairns that marked the path, streamers of fabric whipping in the wind, obscuring the dovahzul inked upon them. Ahead, the glow of the College beckoned, lights of taverns and houses blending with the cold light of magic. A lecture on alchemy in one of the college halls, some time perusing books in the library, then a cold walk back to the Port to find the prospecting crew in Stuhn\u2019s Favored Inn. The next day they would ship out to Atmora, to find whatever awaited them there.</p> <p>But for today and tonight, he had Winterhold.</p> <p>Winterhold, city of magic, city of ice.</p> <p>Of the cities Stithulf had been to, and would ever be to, Winterhold would forever hold a special place in his memory and his heart.</p> <p>Winterhold.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cantons%20of%20the%20Potentate.%20%20Cropsford/","title":"Cantons of the Potentate.

While Daggerfall and Sentinel rose to further power in the wake of the Silver Plague and Wayrest (reluctantly) went back to humbler roots, Camlorn has remained a jewel in the midst of Glenumbra\u2019s hills and fens. A rather darkly gleaming jewel, if one were to be honest enough, with 2 patrons. On the northern end of the city lies the Cathedral of Arkay. The Arkayns are often seen taking pilgrimages further north to tend to Cath Bedraud and the nearby tombs for the citizenry. With the number of tombs that had to be opened (and re-opened) in the plague years, it is difficult for the traveler to tell where the Cath Bedraud begins and ends within the fields of the dead. The maze of fences and gates above ground, combined with the twisting passages of catacombs below, can be vexing for those without a guide. It is highly recommended to the traveller to only go on a pilgrimage in Cath Bedraud as part of a Cathedral group or with one of the Knights of the Circle. It should be noted that punishments for graverobbery, necromancy and assorted other defilement of the dead are extreme in Camlorn.</p> <p>On her southern end, there is the Temple of Dibella. The Prostitutes Guild is, not surprisingly, strongly affiliated with the temple and maintains its housing on either side of the Temple. It has been said that it is the adherence to Dibella that keeps the Guild from falling into more Sanguine-esque ways. The long-standing Festival of Flowers in First Seed sees a vast array of lilies offered on the temple\u2019s steps. For those of a more artistic leaning, the Temple provides many unique paints and dyes for a reasonable donation. After the end of the Silver Plague, a new festival began in Camlorn. In the closing days of Frost Fall, there is a week-long festival that sees both the Cathedral and the Temple driving the celebration. Cycles of the Dead is perhaps one of the wilder times for Arkayns, where the rites of the dead often require a more somber outlook. The Arkayns will be seen in bright red or purple vestments during this week instead of their more neutral colors.</p> <p>During the Cycles of the Dead, Camlorn\u2019s streets are adorned with silvered lilies and various bones. The trees lining the streets clatter with the sound of hollow bone chimes in the wind. The horses of the Order of the Gilded Lily and Knights of the Circle are decorated with silver plates and silver beads on the braided manes as they are paraded through the streets. In the outer ring of the city\u2019s walls, bonfires are common with offerings burnt in the hopes that Arkay will keep the plague away for another year and spare the horses that have been brought in. Masks are common among revelers. Many of the masks are those of death with stylized eyes in a closed position, while the clothing is decorated in bright floral displays. For those not wearing masks, a silvery salve is often used on exposed skin. The Prostitute\u2019s Guild is one of the suppliers of the salve. Costs vary.</p> <p>Meals often feature mock-horse meat in reference to the horses that were slaughtered to feed the populace in the harrowing plague years. It is my understanding that that the contents depend on the chef. While some recipes use apples, carrots, currants, lentils, and spices (particularly the ones in pasties sold on the street side), there are those that use a blend of ground venison and goat. Followers of the Green Pact are encouraged to ask the chef for any concerns regarding the contents used.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20Argonia.%20Helstrom/","title":"Cities of Argonia.

I dread going to sleep but what else can I do, confined that I am in this litter? My limbs shake incontrollably at the slightest movement and my body feels like a furnace. My only company are the daily visits of the healer and Quintus telling me of our progress and how many men we've lost to the Marsh today. Only one this time; he took his turn keeping watch in the night and was nowhere to be found when morning came. Yesterday we lost two; Sulia was devoured by some kind of watery beast and Cecily vomitted blood until Arkay had mercy on her. Well, I think that was yesterday. Keeping track of the days is almost impossible with this ever present mist. Quintus say that, with him included, I only have five escort left. Heh, Quintus, five. I shouldn't laugh. Why not? This Marsh will be the death of us all. I knew I should have never come here, but how could I turn down an order from the Empress-Regent herself? The Argonian guides and porters outnumber us two to one now, and they are all healthy, they could easily kill us all. Is that the plan? Has that snake, Simeus Tharn, bought them to disappear me in this swamp, just like he convinced the Empress-Regent to send me away?</p> <p>Quintus came early today, his face running with sweat, he said we had met some strange locals with wings. I managed to crawl half out of the litter to get a good look. They look like Argonians but they have large leathery wings instead of arms. They rest on them like bats unless they are grasping something with their small fingers. I saw one gliding down and land among our group. They probably can't fly. The guides say this kind of Argonian is called Sarpa, and these say we are only one day's travel from Helstrom. Good. The healer is almost out of salves. Perhaps they will have more and better ones in the city. Hopefully there won't be as many mosquitoes, either. But I doubt it. How could any respectable city exist in this green watery hell? There are no roads, no fields, no civilization, only lizards and monsters, and I can't tell which are which.</p> <p>The Sarpa told the truth, we made it to Helstrom today! I didn't recognize it as a city at first, as it seemed we had stumbled across a wall of vegetation. Then I realized I was looking at a stone building covered in the roots of large dark trees. As I looked around I could see more buildings, walls and great pyramids beyond, all covered in a tangled mass of black roots climbing down to the swamp. A veritable forest sits on this city, each tree filled with orange flowers. As I looked up, a breeze came, carrying the sounds of ringing bells, and we were showered by petals the color of molten gold. For the first time since I've stepped off the boat in Soulrest, I felt at ease. It was like the flowers were trying to tell me something, just below my understanding. Then the moment passed and we moved to the gates. Lamiae were guarding them! The guides insisted they were \"of the Root\" and we had nothing to worry about. The cityscape is dominated by great step pyramids, each topped by an old Hist tree surrounded by what I assume to be its progeny. Around the pyramids, in rows neater than anything I've ever seen of Argonian-make, are square buildings where most of the population seem to live and work. Even at ground level the Hist are omnipresent and the ground is covered in their roots. They are adorned with chimes and surrounded by bowls, gathering sap and attended to by the strangest Argonians I have ever seen. Some looked bloated, other had three or four arms, one I could swear had two heads! This menagerie makes the snake-women look positively normal. We were lead to a pyramid where we will be housed for the duration of our stay. A close look revealed to me the murals underneath the roots. I wish I hadn't. Scenes of carnage and ritual sacrifices, accompanied by the leering faces of demonic creatures. The fever overtook me as we entered and I passed out.</p> <p>My room is spacious but lacking in windows and ventilation. The air feels as heavy as it did during the journey. And now, I have the company of these statues to inspire my nightmares. Above my bed is a snake devouring an entire city while being ridden by human creatures with their heads screwed on the wrong way. Lovely. Tree roots desecend into the room from the ceiling and pass through the floor. One reaches into a pool of water on a wall. I think I am supposed to drink from it too. Healers came, they say my fever is coming down and soon I might be able to consult with the Queen. I tell them I am to speak to the King. they say the last king died thrity years ago and now they have a queen. I need sleep.</p> <p>I dreamt again. Can't recall what of. Wet warm darkness. Perhaps I was awake and that is just what nights are like here? There was a lizard in my room, an ignuana I think they are called. I tried to pet it. It told me that was rude. I went back to sleep. I walked outside of the room and saw my escorts playing dice with an argonian with three eyes. Quintus accompanied me as I toured the pyramid. Couldn't find any windows. As we passed the gate into the plaza outside I felt weak and he took me back to my chamber.</p> <p>I feel like the roots have grown larger. I've talked with some officials, told them I was fit to see their queen now, but they told me I had to wait a few days before \"the Scaled Throne hatched\" whatever that means. Infuriating. How dare they treat an envoy of the Ruby Throne like this? I stormed out and explored the pyramid some more to calm myself. One sloped corridor just keeps descending deeper and deeper, below ground level. At one point it fills with water. I stood there for a moment, looking at it until I saw something halfway between a fish and an Argonian swim towards me. It looked me in the eye for a moment but did not surface. Then it looked to my left and made a bubbling sort of speech. This is when I noticed a soldier wearing an armor dark as night next to me. The soldier told me that was a Saxhleel of the sea, and that many lived in the waters around and below the City and in the waters and oceans of the Marsh. I do not remember how I came back to my room.</p> <p>I visited the city outside the pyramid today. I saw an Argonian with a tail as long as the rest of her body drink Sap directly from a tree and convulse on the ground. I saw another the size of an ogre lugging around two baskets of fruit as big as my torso under each arm with ease. I saw more of the soldiers in black armor, the people move out of their way with fear and offer them fruits for nothing. I asked my interpreter (almost no-one here speaks Tamrielic) and she told me they are called Shadowscales and are the protectors of the Queen. \"Like your Blades\" she said. But then I saw another human being! Olive-skinned and with curly hair, he looked just like another son of the Niben. Delighted to meet a countryman far from home I tried to make conversation but he just stared blankly at me. And then he blinked. With vertical eyelids. As I recoiled in horror, his mouth moved as if to speak, but the only sound that came out of his lips was a snake's hissing. I ran.</p> <p>I sleep again. There was a root that was a snake in a world on fire. A bridge made of branches took it away to the sky, except the sky was the bottom of the sea and I was lost until I found a woman made of wood. She pierced her breast and fire bled from it. I look into the fire and I saw the future. The future burned my mouth when I drank it. I run in the pyramid calling for Quintus and the other escorts but they are not there. I am alone. The statues are mocking me. Warriors of stone from an age of blood, they want blood, they want my blood.</p> <p>The guards took me to the Throne room's antechamber and told me to wait there with the other supplicants. I told them I was an envoy from the Imperial City, that I spoke with the voice of the Emperor himself but they did not care. The antechamber is decorated with dreugh shells hanging from the ceiling. The reliefs on the walls show argonians conquering nations and enslaving them. I am let inside the throne room. It is made of black quartz. The Scaled Throne itself rests on an ebony dais. It is made of the bones of some great beast with large scaly wings erupting from the back, and popped up, like some kind of great dragon. On the throne sits the Queen, the oldest Argonian I have ever seen. Her eyes are white and blind, her pale skin seems too large for her bones, hanging and flapping in places, especially her breasts, or what passes for such in Argonians. She is naked except for a feather headress, in the middle of which rests a glowing withe-gold gem, and an assortment of bones hanging from her limbs. I approach her and she feels my face with her hand. I realize her left arm goes through the open mouth of a Dunmeri skull. Her breath reeks of rotten meat. I tell her that I am Ambassador from his Terrible and Awesome Majesty Emperor Uriel Septim the Sixth and his mother, Her Excellency the Empress-Regent Thonica, sent here to receive the homage Black Marsh owes to the Red Dragon Crown as welll as settle the matter of taxes to be collected from the Inner Marsh.</p> <p>She laughed at me! She spoke as if she was the Emperor's equal, said that Helstrom and the Inner Marsh never bowed to the Septim Crown and that many other rulers, from the lords of the Deep Ocean to the Akaviri, courted her wealth and power. She then showed me an absurd map. It showed Black Marsh and all the familiar settlements, but the scale was all wrong: the map claimed that it was larger than entire rest of Tamriel, despite the cities circling the Province not being any farther from each other as they are on Imperial maps.</p> <p>When I left the queen, I went up, instead of down. I climbed all the way to the top of the Royal pyramid, the largest of the city. There I found the largest Hist tree I have ever seen. As I looked into its trunk I suddenly saw a face in the bark, shaped by the crevices in the wood. It was my own and it was laughing. I turned away and looked at the night sky on the horizon. Why are the night stars the wrong color!?</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20Freehold.%20Port%20Dibellum/","title":"Cities of Freehold.

Now these ruined vessels are maintained along the craggy shores and adorned with religious iconography. Every 5th of First Seed a Battlemaster bedecked in onyx robes performs the Rite of Sacred Remembrance to remind folk that the title is that of priesthood, not merely an elite warrior. Unlike in other parts of Freehold society, Republic Day is a solemn affair here; during the Rite the known names of everyone who died valiantly in the Battle on both sides are invoked - because War is sacred in Ebonarm theology, and even the enemy must be honored as a partaker in the sacred struggle.\u00a0</p> <p>Further into the city, the array of sacred spaces continues. The Temple of Dibella is most interesting: renovated from Reman-era ruins, the crystalline architecture and especially the pointed ears of the Goddess would likely horrify certain members of that ancient regime. The Passion Dancer is depicted here as the \u201cBeautiful Wind\u201d, a nymph-like being with the Kynaren Dove sitting atop her shoulder. Meanwhile, a sphinx-shrine of Khenarthi can be found guarding the local catacombs, and Auridon Paladins pray at the Temple of Phynaster filled with reflective copper statuary. Coral totems of Satakaal can be found on every street corner, cast in the Pyandonean style. Outside the city, a sacred grove surrounded by stone-crafted pelican and sea turtle icons emphasizes the sky-and-sea aspect of Jephre which has become more prominent among the Freehold Bosmer.</p> <p>In the tavern corners, hidden tunnels, and dark alleys, prayers are breathed out in secret to the darker spirits: Nocturnal, Boethiah, and most hated by all Freehold loyalists this close to the South, Baan Dar. The memory of the corsairs is obviously still fresh in the mind of Port Dibellum\u2019s citizenry, and most respectable folk look with disdain upon any who seem to flirt with the spirit of piratical defiance. Suffice it to say that visitors to the city of Port Dibellum should be careful not to show too much public affection for these rebellious spirits, to avoid incident.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20Resdayn.%20Marandus/","title":"Cities of Resdayn.

In the center of the stronghold resides the Askhan of the Urshilaku, a title which is all but synonymous with Gah-Khan of the Great Tribes. Representatives from smaller tribes and clans flock to the doors, waiting and at times begging for an audience with the Great Chief of Chiefs of Resdayn.</p> <p>On the western shores are the markets and residences, most made from adobe, which passes for \u201costentatious\u201d among the tribal Velothi. The poorer, or simply more conservative, Ashlanders live in guarhide tents further out from the lake. To the north lie farms of wickwheat and ash yams. Despite its age it is a humble and rustic place, favored by Dunmeri travelers looking to get away from the modern world and rediscover their ancestral past.</p> <p>The true value of Marandus lies not in the city itself, of course, but in its location. Lake Nabia is the first great body of water near Red Mountain, and following the river southward one will drain into the Inner Sea. Ores collected from the north are brought here to be shipped to Suran, and from there all over the Star-Wounded East. It is partially through their control of Nabia that the Urshilaku remain relevant in Resayn\u2019s economy. The gulakhans and warriors know this well, making regular patrols of the lake and the river alike. Banditry is common, though dealt with swiftly.</p> <p>Unlike their more thin-skinned kin, the Urshilaku have come to expect the presence of outlanders, especially following the alliance with the Redoran Hortator.

The Ouada Tong, in partnership with the East Empire Company, offers tours of the most important historical sites in the former capital of the Star-Wounded East. As you arrive by boat at the western docks coming in from the river, take note of the East Empire Company offices and warehouse buildings, taking in local marshmerrow and other cash crops picked by the local Tong-backed farmers. Despite rumors to the contrary, slavery is still abolished in Resdayn, the enduring legacy of the Potentate\u2019s sagacious influence. Also on the docks you may find the headquarters of the Ouada Tong, a sub-order of the Temple founded to provide representation to the common people of Resdayn, in line with the ideals of Saint Almalexia whose presence is still felt in the City of Love.</p> <p>Once you are inside the Mourning Hold, you will notice that Godsreach, once a noble district, is now primarily dedicated to Craftsmer halls of every sort. The Hall of Saint Aralor houses tanners, the Hall of Saint Delyn potters and glassmakers, the Hall of Saint Llothis tailors and dyers, and the Hall of Saint Sil artificers and clockmakers. The Resdaynian Tongs are not as open as western Guilds, being tied to the Temple and Dunmeri heritage. If you are an outlander looking for employment, you would be best advised to search elsewhere. Godsreach is also the location of the famed Winged Guar. The Nerevarine is said to have slept in the very tavern, and it remains a popular drinking spot, open to outlanders so long as you remain polite and keep your religious beliefs to yourself.</p> <p>In the center is the Palace of Barenziah, Saint-Mother of Potentate Helseth, now occupied by the Grandmaster of House Indoril. Pilgrims from the Potentate frequently visit to pay homage to the ancestral home of Saint Barenziah, only to be coldly greeted by Indoril oathmer annoyed at the frequent visits from Western \u201cheretics.\u201d The Indoril still hold power in Resdayn through the Temple and, by extension, the Tongs. Hold yourself with the highest decorum in the Palace, for you represent the Potentate in this divided land.</p> <p>To the north lies the High Temple district, where the current Alma Rula, Indoril Valys, reigns. The Temple has been reconsecrated in the name of the Reclamations, but a shrine to Saint Almalexia remains tucked away in a corner. The Morag Tong guildhall is located on the eastern end of this district, that old order now answering directly to the Alma Rula as the mortal voice of Black-Hands Mephala. The Morag Tong rarely takes writs of execution that are not aligned with Temple interests, which are also Indoril interests. If you have criminal intent, do not expect these assassins to sell their service; they are not the Dark Brotherhood of old.</p> <p>The southern part of the city, Plaza Brindisi Dorom, contains free clinics and hostels for those unable to afford other taverns. More pertinent to the history-minded traveler, it is the entrance to the ancient ruins of Bamz-Amschend, a vast underground museum of Dwemer artifacts located in what was once an actual Dwemer city. You will have a chance to see their schematics for centurion spiders, the ancient Dumac currency, and even a working colossus. The museum also contains miniaturized replicas of Dwemer animunculi in the gift shop. The museum curators, the Eastern History Society, are dedicated to connecting the modern people of Tamriel to the ancient world of Lost Dwemeris.</p> <p>The eastern section of the city is the Great Bazaar. It is here you will find exotic foods and ingredients from across the eastern continent, from Belladonna berries from Solstheim to the hackle-lo leaves of the Bitter Coast to salamander meat from Narsis. The latest fashions from Auridon can be purchased, as well as Alto wine imported from Eastmarch. The Bazaar is also home to the Mournhold Players outdoor theater. They still put on all of the old classics, such as The Horror of Castle Xyr and A Hypothetical Treachery. This year, however, Drayvis Sandus announced his intention to put on a new historical drama called Ebony and Ruby, which will promote his desires for greater friendships between the Potentate and Resdayn.

It's more cosmopolitan than one might expect of a conservative Redoran town - that's the influence of the Molag'kena.

The local thieves run rampant across the roguish port, much to the chagrin of the growing intellectual elite.</p> <p>The installation of the great ingenium workshop was a minor miracle, worked by a local clique of psychomancers determined to give their home a better name than that of banditry and cheap wine.

Alcaire","text":"<p>Alcaire sits nestled among the hills near the mouth of a long river that eventually drains into the Iliac Bay, traversed by ships loaded with ebony from the Wrothgarian Mountains to the northeast. It is thus a vital trade outpost, but it is also famous among those who still revere Saint Tiber as one of the many sites claimed to be his birthplace. Pilgrims beware, however, for the region has a long history of lawlessness and barbarism.</p> <p>Castle Alcaire was built during the Reman Empire, ruled by a Duke appointed by said Emperor who claimed to own all of the surrounding environment. Of course, the local Manmeri clans had little respect for the hereditary noble \u201ctyrants\u201d imposed by foreigners, and continued to farm and herd much as they always had. Occasionally, the Duke would send his own knightly order, at some point dubbed the \u201cOrder of the Flame,\u201d to bring the barbarians into line. The clans would begrudgingly accept demands to pay some taxes in kind, but the rural folk had a chivalric tradition of their own, and would start to fight back.</p> <p>A major turning point was the fall of the Flyte rulers. Auberon Flyte was the appointed \u201cLord of all Alcaire\u201d during the reign of the Septim Dynasty. He was tutored in Wayrest, and began to expect that he could command the same authority as the Septim rulers. The witch-knights responded poorly to his attempt to establish law and order, and after a period of guerilla fighting the Flytes escaped to Reich Gradkeep (later renamed Anticlere). Lord Flyte took the Knights of the Flame with him, and from then on hereditary rule was all but finished in the Alcaire region. A ceremonial line of rulers continued to exist until the fall of the Mede Empire, but they were ultimately dependent upon the local folk-knights\u2019 tolerance.</p> <p>The Temple of Kynareth in Alcaire emphasizes her role as the Sky-Mother and Mistress of the Elements. Local lore holds that Kynareth was the First Witch, breathing life into the clay figures that became the first humans, but also took up the storm-blade of a knight to free her wife Y\u2019ffre and the Breton people from the tyrannical sons of Sheor. People from the region often send their daughters to the local Alcaire Wyrd to be trained in the ancient arts of elemental magicka. They usually go on to become warrior-priestesses at the Temple, or respected members of the knightly forums in the city or the outlying hamlets. The eldest of their number become attuned to the very elements; one has eyes of burning black coal, veins pulsating with fire; another has pallid skin and blue lips, ice-crystals clinging to her hair and flesh.</p> <p>Saint Tiber Septim - naturally - plays a role in their myths. The son of Kynareth, it is said he learned sword-mastery from the knights of the city and learned magic among the witches of the hills (a rare privilege for a man). Yet he later betrayed them all to join the Colovian hordes and conquer the world, albeit bringing about an age of peace and prosperity in so doing. He was raised up on his deathbed and joined the Heavens as a star, only to later be shot down by the jealous Thalmor. Every Tibedetha is therefore a day of mourning, all members of the city dressed in black, and the priestesses perform a vigil for the Fallen Son at his shrine. Tiber\u2019s apparent moral ambiguity in their provincial mythology does not diminish his popularity. All Gods are understood by Alcairens to be good and evil in equal measure; Kynareth is the kindly mother who waters the crops, and the vengeful warrior who burns the forest with a bolt of lightning.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all this unchecked influence of witchery and rural traditionalism has made the region unsafe, as shipments are ransacked for supposedly \u201cstealing\u201d Nature's gifts to sell them to foreigners. The local merchant knights, backed by those of other city-states in the League, have taken steps to remedy this by investing in a secular magic school (using the former Mages Guild hall) and enacting more aggressive patrols along the river and roads. As you may suspect, this exacerbates tension between the competing groups, and it may be that only a firm outside hand can keep the peace in the Land of Tiber.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20the%20Iliac%20League.%20Kairou/","title":"Cities of the Iliac League. Kairou","text":"<p>Located in the savanna of the southwestern Iliac Bay, Kairou is a minor city of the League in economic terms, relying on the trade of sorghum and legumes grown in the region, but it is also a prime example of the variety found in decentralized Iliac religion. The famous Chil'a holiday on the 24th of Evening Star sees the High Priest of Zeht concentrating the ashes of the Old Year's sacrificed crops and praying for the rebirth of the New Year. For in this land, Zeht is not only an agricultural deity, but also the God of Death and Rebirth.</p> <p>The unique mythology of Kairoun divinity starts similarly enough to other Redguard cultures, with Sep creating the world and Zeht forsaking his father to provide life to the people of this world. From there, the story shifts radically. Kairou has demonized the traditional Life-Death deity, Arkay. Sometimes he is depicted as the Thieving Jackal, a faithful hound of Tall Papa who hunts for wayward souls and drags them to the underworld to be punished with Sep. His other avatar is the Rotted Ghoul, who haunts burial grounds devouring minds and spirits. Regardless, he is the one who killed Zeht for the farm deity\u2019s rebellion against Tall Papa.</p> <p>As Zeht lingers in the underworld, the land grows barren and dry. Morwha has mercy on her son, however, and so alongside Tava (Zeht\u2019s sister, in these tales) undertakes a spiritual ritual which briefly revives Zeht from the dead. The endless cycle begins, as Zeht reigns briefly on the mortal realm during rainy seasons before descending back to the underworld during dry seasons, for one who has tasted the underworld can never leave it forever.</p> <p>Reincarnation is thus central to Karioun spirituality, and they have little interest in the Far Shores. Like many Redguards they mummify their dead and inter them in ancient necropolises such as the nearby Crypts of V\u2019ild. The people of Kairou also believe in their own variation of the tripartite soul. While the breath is taken back by Tava, and the mind resides forever in the necropolis, the spirit will be reborn in a new body so long as it is not captured by the Jackal or the Ghoul. For these reasons Kairouns often make pilgrimages to pray to the departed and offer gifts, lest the minds go mad and become wandering phantoms.</p> <p>The origins for this peculiarity in tradition is debated. Some argue it is a holdover from some forgotten Nedic mythology adopted by the invading Redguards, others suggest it is evidence that the anti-Sep bias of most Redguards was not always so universal (a claim seemingly supported by the Sep cults of the Yokedate deserts). Regardless, it is no secret that the local clergy are not on good terms with the Arkayn temples found in the rest of the Bay.</p> <p>______</p> <p>Kairou has always resented Sentinel\u2019s domination of the Iliac Bay. And Sentinel\u2019s patron deity is Arkay. Or Tu\u2019whacca, or whatever they call him. Makes sense to me that they'd call the leaders of Sentinel a bunch of thieving jackals.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20the%20Iliac%20League.%20Satakalaam%2C%20The%20Desert%20Mirage/","title":"Cities of the Iliac League. Satakalaam, The Desert Mirage","text":"<p>The city of Satakalaam stands out among other Iliac League cities in a lot of ways. For one, it is one of the few cities that are situated so far inland they do not have a port or a harbor.</p> <p>More importantly, it is much different from the other cities of the south of the Bay in what concerns culture and customs. In the old Hammerfell it would be characterized as being of the 'Crown' persuasion. The local knightly families trace their descent from Na-Totambu nobility and gentry, not from the Ra-Gada warriors. Those who don't belong to the Na Shira most often have relatives in the nomad clans of Alik'r desert. Marketplaces of Satakalaam is where you may hear actually contemporary spoken Yoku in all it's imperfections - not the carefully constructed language they employ on Stros M'Kai.</p> <p>The very obvious sign of difference is a huge ancient temple of Satakal that presides over the city. Inside, it is full of carefully restored mosaics depicting the scenes of the traditional Yokudan theology - the world serpent eating itself, Ruptga placing the stars on the sky, Tu'whacca guiding the spirits, Ruptga's victory over Sep. One of the mosaics is of obviously different make, and depicts an Imperial Julianos - the reminder of the dark times when the temple was forcibly converted to his worship. The next mosaic is even more different, and most recent, even if done in the ancient style - it shows Julianos in his aspect as an Owl, following Ruptga's stars.</p> <p>If you ask the priests of the Temple, they will say that they follow and accept the spiritual primacy of the Southern Emperor (perhaps not the best term, but it's still the best short translation of his title of the King of Kings, Heir of the Gods, Highest Priest, the Last Arbiter and the Keeper of the Sacred Blade). Despite that, you will not see the laws of Totambu enforced in the city. And most emphatically, you will not find the military government of a Yokeda here.</p> <p>For all their differences, big and small, Satakalaans are Iliacs to their core in the most important aspect - they are merchant-knights, as unwilling to accept any power above themselves as any other Iliac polity. Their trade may be not seaborne, but they are as important a hub as any port, as it is the final stop of the long caravan route going all the way from Dunei.</p> <p>Satakalaam's military independence hinges on the last very important difference. We all know that Iliacs cling to the out-dated Galerion's paradigm of magic. For the knights, magic is a craft, not a science, so they prefer simplistic old and tried methods, instead of striving for the advancement. But where the knights of other cities practice in the fields of Destruction and Alteration - most fitting for the immediate application on the battlefield - Satakalaans prefer Illusion.</p> <p>That is the origin of the second name of the city, 'the Desert Mirage'. The squads of the knights patrol the desert around the city, throwing up the miraculous visions of the tall towers, blue roofs, glittering fountains and lush greenery - far exceeding the actual city in beauty, I must say. Only when guided by another Satakalaan knight (or, the rumor says, one of the Mother Navigators) is the caravan able to find the real city safely. This clever usage of magic helped the city to keep its peace, and its trade safe in the face of the dangerous neighbors it has - the Bjoulsae, the Reachmen and even the Totambu border raids.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20the%20Potentate.%20Bravil%2C%20the%20Mother%27s%20Heart/","title":"Cities of the Potentate. Bravil, the Mother's Heart","text":"<p>Before setting your sights on the lengthy travel outside of the Potentate it is a good idea to first explore all our homeland has to offer. The city of Bravil stands second only to the Capital in the amount of visitors it receives. Majority of them are the pilgrims from all over Tamriel, and most of the rest are researchers and historians, as the Temple - the Benevolence, as it called - holds its vaults and libraries open. One of the most curious exponates is a miniature model of the interior as it looked in the Third Eras, under what is now known as 'Septim doctrines' - stark and simple, with only stained glass windows devoted for individual Divines for decoration. Where once Thousand Cults flourished, then were only parishioners hurrying to the Sundas service.</p> <p>Currently, the Benevolence presents itself much differently, as over the last centuries it was extended both over and under the ground. Smaller chapels, annexes, subdivided chambers - all of them are devoted to the different aspects of the Mother. Each is full of small statues, figurines, portraits and icons of Mother's Saints. Day and night the Benevolence is illuminated by the soft glow of thousands upon thousands of candles and scented oil lamps the pilgrims light as a prayer, a thanks, or just a remembrance.</p> <p>Some of the chambers contain tombs of the important characters of the Temple history, chief among them the Primate Fianna Georick, who played a crucial role in overturning the Septim doctrines back in the third century. </p> <p>An astronomer, a researcher and a priest, she is said one day to nail a pamphlet with her theses at the door of the Temple - the original of the pamphlet is displayed under glass over her tomb. In this paper she succinctly argued against the dogmatic rigidity of the Cult of the Eight, against the astronomical nonsense of identifying the Divines with the planets and against the simplistic characterization of the Divine spheres of influence. Instead, she argued for meditation and strive for self-improvement for laypeople, assisted by the mendicant priesthood.</p> <p>She later defended her position in the public debate, and the popular legend  insists she was pronounced the new Primate on the spot by the cheering crowd. The reality was more complicated, and it took her several decades to gain the position. The theological dispute between the candidates, however, had become the tradition in the following century, and now is used to elect not only the Primate, but also the head priests of various local temples.</p> <p>This transition to community-elected priesthood went not without issues, but the intervention of the Elder Council prevented the all-out religious conflict with the Archbishop of the One. The atmosphere at the Council of Eight still remains tense, though, and each new Primate of Mara demands recognition and a personal invitation before coming to the Imperial City.</p> <p>YgM: It is certainly convenient to have religious leaders owing you favors, can't argue.</p> <p>Another notable tomb - and another important character in the Benevolence history - is Primate Maralie Balu al-Riften. It is under her guidance that Fianna's general idea of self-improvement and her inspirations from the Breton folk theology had taken the shape of the doctrine of the Saints as we know it. In a very similar way to the Ancestors doctrine of the Arkay Temple of Cheydinhal, but going even a step further, Primate Maralie had recognized the sacrifices of all those mortals who have stepped past the mortal death, and preceded by Mara (in any of her shapes, including the Loving Mother and the Fierce She-Wolf) exhibited miracles or imparted knowledge in the waking world. In addition to the traditional figures like Saint Balyna and Saint Olava, the worship of Saint Martin and Saint Veloth were among the first to be recognized as being part of the Temple, but later other, sometimes more contradictory figures, followed - Saint Vekh, Saint Tiber, Saint Arctus, and many, many more.</p> <p>YgM: Sounds so pretty when you put it this way, but I just can't shake the feeling how easy it is to bring each and every religion under the heel. 'All the gods and spirits you worship are obviously Saints, now bow to our superior and all-encompassing doctrine'.</p> <p>The current Primate, S'Teifi-ko af-Bani, is unique among the hierarchs to not receive a formal education in any of the lesser temples of Mara. She rather comes from the oral tradition of the Mother-Navigators of the western plains. It didn't prevent her from emerging victorious in the debate, and her weekly sermons are one of the main attractions for the visiting pilgrims.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20the%20Potentate.%20Port%20Katariah/","title":"Cities of the Potentate.

If seen from above, the city would look like a giant hook, puling a piece of land into the Niben River. The handle of the hook is a breakwater, terminating in a giant lighthouse.</p> <p>The whole architecture of the city is massive and solid, with sloped walls, oblique angles, windowless outer surfaces of gray ash-cement. Covered walkways, blunted pyramids of the housing quarters. Dunmer may say it is a memory of Vivec's ziggurats, but in actuality, the inspiration was taken from the ancient blueprints of Reman's lunar settlement. Designed to withstand the magica storms of the outer Aetherus, it serves well against the weathers of the Topal Bay. Whether it will be a seasonal rain that doesn't let up for months, or the giant waves brought by the clashing currents.</p> <p>The inside of the housing pyramids is the direct opposite of the outside. The brutal angularity is broken down into the mer-men-sized cozyness of a cave. Tilted twisting corridors, comfortable nooks and crannies, benches of thick softwood. The enchanted lanterns cast the pure untainted golden light of Magnus-Sun.</p> <p>It serves not only for pleasure of the eye, but allows to bring the agriculture under the roof. The fruit-bearing plants cover the walls, with the streams of water running endlessly from top to bottom, filling the corridors with their soft melody. Each pyramid is a self-sufficient creature, taking only water and air to create food for its inhabitants.</p> <p>The clever narrow window-slits of Alteration-infused crystal are not seen from the outside, but give a perfect view of the waves breaking against the walls of the city even in the worst storm. Together with the dampening of the sound - for the corridors are both designed and enchanted with Illusion to not spread even the softest echo - it creates an impression as otherworldly as any Daedric realm.</p> <p>All taken together, the city is the perfect embodiment of the worship and belief of our Potentate. A contradiction thrust upon itself, a hardened ash-shell protecting the luxurious gardens. An artificial cliff, raised to meet every wave of challenge at oblique angle. The seed of the old novelty grown into the new tradition.</p> <p>YgM: It took some arrogance and stupidity to choose the only place on the coast where the waves can get higher than the trees, and put the city there. And it's a boring place, with the current population of soldiers and sailors rattling in the halls built for hundreds of thousands, like dried peas in a pod.</p> <p>The sensory deprivation effect of the sound dampening doesn't help either. They tell that some of the first wave of the settlers went mad and still wander the corridors, always taking just the wrong turn. No wonder drinking is the main pastime - fortunately all those fruits make a decent shein.</p> <p>And I don't stand for all that architectural mysticism. 'City as a divine body', my ass. Although I'm sure the guys from Port Topal would say their city is the divine geometry of Baan Dar.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Cities%20of%20the%20Potentate.%20Rimmen/","title":"Cities of the Potentate. Rimmen","text":"<p>Of all the cities of the Potentate, Rimmen, the Gateway to the West, was the latest to join the fold. And yet, Rim'kha as the native Khajiit call her, has a long history that stretches back to the Merethic Era, as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Catfolk, as the capital of the Confedered Realm of Anequina and as the homeland of the Rim-Men, descendants of ancient Nedes, Cyrodiils and Akaviri who briefly established their own nation there in the Second Era, after which the city is named.</p> <p>Seating atop a great hill, Rimmen oversees the High Savannah and its crops of maize, soy and above all moonsugar cane, all irrigated by the many tributaries of the Niben that run through the region. But the city's main source of wealth has always been its location. It seats at the crossing of the roads linking the port-city of Leyawiin to ore-rich Colovia, the caravan-center of Orcrest to the Niben and her many silk produce, and is a major stop on the \"Sugar Road\"^(1) from Torval to Sul in Resdayn.</p> <p>For the weary traveller to enter the city, they must first cross the great Baandari Bazaar that sprawls under the walls. First established by the Baandari Peddlers that gave it its name, this nigh-endless sea of tents is now the domain of the carvans of the Mother-Navigators. The discerning customer may find there wares and treasures from all over Tamriel for a low price... provided they do not question the origin of those goods too much, and mind the cutpurses of course. Next to the city gates, and contrasting the cheerful chaos of the Bazaar, our traveler will find the solemn, marbled, offices the East Empire Company (second only in size to their seat in Cheydinhal), insuring a flow of trustworthy and reliable trade into the Potentate from Western Tamriel and back.</p> <p>Once inside the city proper, the traveller will discover a charming mix of ancient and grandiose Khajiiti architecture and the utilitarian Imperial style of Cyrodiil, with, here or there, the occasionnal Akaviri folly. Most of the population is made of Khajiit (the third largest ethnicity in the Potentate), but a great number of Rim-men will be seen in the City at all times, coming and going from their villages all over the Rim where they maintain their culture separate from that of their neighbouring Khajiiti. But no Rim-Man would visit Rimmen without paying his respect at the Tonekana Shrine. This cyclopean construction is adorned with ten thousand statuettes, half an Altmer's size, portraying Akaviri in all manner of everyday situations. Of those ten thousand, five stand out being three meters in height, one looking at each of the cardinal points and one on the roof. Who or what these five represented is lost to history, but most suspect them to be traditionnal Tsaesci gods, possbily linked to the Elements. There are even rumors of a sixth \"evil\" statue below the shrine. But since there is no way inside the building, that remains a mystery.</p> <p>The oldest building in the city is without a doubt the great Two-Moon Temple at the highest point of the city, where the devout come to pay their respect to the Ja'kha-jay and marvel at the Lunar Orrerry, a model of Nirn and its moons capable of predicting their positions and phases with such accuracy that it takes one thousand years for it to be late by one day (or so the priests claim). The temple itself is covered in beautiful mosaics depicting the heavens. Some visiting scholars claim a few of the symbols to be Julianite in origin, but most serious historian dismiss that claim as absurdly anachronistic. On the other side of the Great Avenue, stands the Sand Palace, so called for the distinct yellowish color of its stonework, making it appears from a distance as an impossibly tall sandcastle and for the devotion of its inhabitants to Alkosh, the Khajiiti name for the Great Dragon, traditional patron-god of Anequina. Indeed, the Alessian-style chapel that flanks it is in fact the Great Temple of Alkosh, its exterior having been repaired in Cyrodiilic fashion by the first Count of Rimmen after the city joined the Potentate.^(2) As Imperial as the outside of the building is, the interior is unmistakably khajiiti, as the walls form a single great sky-colored fresca, depicting a seemingly infinite Alkosh in majesty, coiled around the visitors ruling over the World and the Heavens, with all the divine spirits holding court t his side. The god's eyes, made of two great gemsetones, seem to stare directly into the souls of all who walk into the sanctuary.</p> <p>In the southern district, the traveller will find a more recent (only fourteen centuries old) temple, smaller, but no less richly decorated than the others, dedicated to Azura, the Lady of Dawn and Dusk, who the Catflok revere as the mother of their entire race. It is know for its garden of roses, reputedly blessed by the goddess to help those who smell their perfume to find love soon. Many Dunmer migrants to the city frequent this temple with great assiduity and in fact, some of its oldest serving priests are now Dark Elves themselves.^(3)</p> <p>If you are more curious than prudent, you may leave the city itself and travel to the Rimmen Necropolis, where are buried the legions of the First Era Dagonite warlord Darloc Brae. Indisputably, they are masterworks of funerary rites, is seeing them worth the curse that allegedly pursues all who visits them?</p> <p>1. Skooma Road. 2. I wonder why the Temple needed repairs following the annexation. Or why the ruling family, by all accounts deeply traditionalists followers of the Riddle-Thar suddenly felt the need to show how culturally compatible they were with Cyrodiil. Good thing we live in an age of religious tolerance, heh? 3. All this talk of grand palaces and temples, and not a single mention of the most prevalent shrines in the city? At every corner you'll find a niche with a small wooden statue of Riddle'Thar (or Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, no-one could give me a clear explanation) carved by the people of the neighbourhood, that they touch when leaving their home in the morning and going back to it in the evening to be blessed for the day.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Holds%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20Aalto/","title":"Holds of Snow Throat. Aalto","text":"<p>For those who peruse ancient maps or secluded mages and elves, the existence of the Aalto as an independent hold may come as a surprise. Historically, the region has been part of Eastmarch - in truth, most of Eastmarch was what is today the Aalto.</p> <p>As with all three of Snow-Throat\u2019s \u201cnew holds\u201d - Giant\u2019s Gap, the Aalto, and Ilinalta Hold - the separation of old and new has its roots in the Civil War of the late 4e190s and early 4e200s. As with much of eastern Skyrim, Eastmarch hold had undergone an economic regression from productive economy to an extractive model, allegedly as a result of a planned Imperial economic shift to replace lost sources of raw materials from Resdayn. While the hold capital of Windhelm remained largely untouched by this shift - indeed, the increase in exports seems to have buoyed the fortunes of the city - the rest of the hold struggled under the new economic regime. Unrest stemming from economic malaise, though drowned out by religious fervor and general anti-Empire sentiment, in turn fueled the Stormcloak Rebellion, with the prospect of a return to a productive economy rousing general support and disaffected subjects providing a large pool of recruits for the rebel army.</p> <p>The hopes of eastern Skyrim to regain their lost economy were dashed by the Dragon Crisis and ensuing truce between the Stormcloaks and Imperial representatives. As the civil war petered out, the wartime demand for both raw materials and finished goods shrank, and the economic malaise returned tenfold. Dissatisfied with the inability - if not unwillingness - of the Stormcloak leadership to address the problems faced by their supporters, the southern regions of Eastmarch began a slow divorce from the capital, something only accelerated by the death of Talos in the Tibedetha Incident and collapse of Stormcloak unity in the months and years following. By the time the Plague arrived in Skyrim, the Aalto had left Eastmarch in all but name. In place of a single unified government, a cult of Kyne had taken hold, serving to connect the disparate towns, forts, and camps, priestesses and hunters walking the wilds and steaming crags to hold court with giants and orcs in the wastes of the caldera.</p> <p>Today, the simplest definition of the Aalto\u2019s boundaries is that the Aalto begins where other holds end. The White River marks most of the border between Eastmarch and the Aalto, with the Velothi mountains in the east separating Resdayn and Snow-Throat. In the south, Ysgramor\u2019s Teeth divide the Rift from the Aalto, and in the west, Whiterun shares a small border with the hold, along the Guldun River.</p> <p>Most permanent settlements in the Aalto are clustered along the rivers or situated in a great ring around the caldera, beads of towns and towers strung out on a necklace of roads, camps, and rivers.</p> <p>Kynesgrove, the capital, is one of the northernmost major settlements in the hold, a sprawling town that sits on the White River. Named for the sacred grove of Kyne it is built near, the town is nonetheless a major stop on the river for the logging and shipbuilding trade, as well as the most common point of export for the hold\u2019s crops of jazbay, dragon\u2019s tongue, and genuine alto wine, a revered delicacy only able to be brewed with grapes grown in the caldera. Kynesgrove is also the most convenient route to the Orsimer stronghold of Narzulbur, one of Snow-Throat\u2019s most prominent Orcish communities and a major supplier of the nation\u2019s ebony, alongside the imports from Resdayn\u2019s Raven Rock mines.</p> <p>The Grove at Kynesgrove is the seat of the hold\u2019s jarl. Unusually among the jarls of the Commonwealth, the executive head of the Aalto is not elected - rather, she - for the jarl is always a woman - is appointed, with the position being granted to the most senior priestess of Kyne in the hold.</p> <p>Traveling south along the White will bring one into contact with the many fishing and crabbing settlements on the Aalto bank of the river. Woodcutting and logging industries are largely absent on the Aalto bank due to a notable lack of trees, though many of the locks that have been built along the White are constructed on the Aalto side, servicing the multitude of river boats, grain barges, and log runners that ply the waters.</p> <p>The Darkwater and Guldun Rivers that feed the White have some of the hold\u2019s largest communities and amounts of arable land. Ecologically more similar to Eastmarch\u2019s southern lands, the town of Fort Amol is sometimes referred to as the hold\u2019s southern capital, and the largest farming and logging town in the hold. Darkwater Crossing, a mining community further upstream, is a major supplier of corundum for Snow-Throat\u2019s forges and manufactories.</p> <p>The most notable locations in the Aalto\u2019s south, however, are the mead hall of the Silver Companions and the Eldergleam Sanctuary, a nearby holy site of Kyne under the protection of the storied warrior band. The Silver Companions were granted land in the Aalto in the late years of the 4e200s, after the Battle of the Shore, when an invasion of Falmer was driven back underground in large part due to the heroic actions of the then-homeless Silver Companions, under the leadership of Harbinger Orgnar of the Axe. The Silver Companions have built a veritable town and port on the bank of the Darkwater, replete with a personal fleet of ships and training ground for the myriad of would-be warriors and shield-brothers and sisters.</p> <p>The interior of the Aalto is sparsely settled. The vast caldera is a wild land, populated by hermits, mystics, hunters and wanderers, living among the crags and steam, moving from hidden altar to hidden altar, camping at long-lost standing stones. Poorly suited for conventional agriculture, jazbay plantations nonetheless can be found among the sulfur springs, tended by nomadic botanists and vintners. Rumors claim that the center of the caldera is home to a monastery of Dragon Monks, a claim that remains difficult to verify.</p> <p>The Aalto is one of Snow-Throat\u2019s strangest holds, distinct in government, ecology, and traditions. Nonetheless, the hold may be an attractive destination for merchants: ebony from Narzulbur, rare herbs, ingredients, and wines may all be found here, cheaper than elsewhere in Tamriel. For the religiously minded, the hold contains pilgrimage sites aplenty: the sacred Grove of Kyne at Kynesgrove, a dragon mound sacred to the hero-god Ysmir Alduin, the ancient Eldergleam Sanctuary, hidden altars and standing stones that one would need a guide to find. The Silver Companions offer a home for the wandering warrior, and may be hired to deal with threats mundane and magical for the proper fee - or to carry out expeditions and trade upon their fleet of longships.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Holds%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20Eastmarch/","title":"Holds of Snow Throat. Eastmarch","text":"<p>The name of Eastmarch Hold is something of a misnomer - since the secession of the Aalto and the reorganization of eastern Skyrim into the Snow-Throat Commonwealth, Eastmarch no longer commands most of the eastern marches, nor is it eastern - in truth, the hold is one of the Commonwealth\u2019s central holds.</p> <p>Much of the lands that now make up Eastmarch were once part of the defunct hold of the Pale, now split between Eastmarch, Giant\u2019s Gap, and the Jarldom of Dawnstar. The western frontier of Eastmarch consists of the east-west valley in which Lake Yorgrim lies - a land sparsely settled. Much of the land is taiga, marching up the mountain slopes until the trees give way to snowberry bushes and bare rock. Hidden among the crags on both the north and south slopes of the valley are ancient Dwemer ruins and Nordic tombs - both forbidding prospects for the unwary wanderer. More welcoming might be the monasteries of the Dragon Monks - if they can be found.</p> <p>Lake Yorgrim and the surrounding communities are the headwaters of Eastmarch\u2019s most prominent industry. It is said that almost no life in Eastmarch is untouched by the rivers and ocean, something that rings true even here. Logging camps in the forest deliver lumber to the lake to be floated downstream to the sawmills and shipyards that cluster the banks of the Yorgrim River. Most of Snow-Throat\u2019s ships are built here, clinker-built hulls and shallow drafts perfectly suited for both the icy waters of the Sea of Ghosts and the rivers of Skyrim alike.</p> <p>South of the Uttering Hills runs the White River. Eastmarch claims the north bank, but this stretch, though more temperate than the rest of the hold, has few permanent inhabitants. Giant clans make camp in the forests alongside intrepid woodcutters, but the dark history of shipburnings during the Silver Plague has kept most settlers away. The town of Mixwater Mill is the largest settlement on the Eastmarch side between the militia fort of Morvunskar and Whiterun\u2019s portaging station of Valthiem Towers, makes good business more in serving and servicing the riverboats that ply the White and Darkwater than it does in milling logs and grain.</p> <p>Windhelm and Slaughterfish Bay are the heart of Eastmarch. Once the City of Kings, Windhelm is now the City of Skalds: the seat of Dibella\u2019s priesthood in Snow-Throat. Credited with saving the city during the Silver Plague, the priestesses - known as the Silver Moths - are patronesses of the arts in Windhelm. The Palace of Kings, their temple, is equal parts religious site and museum, preserving the past and present of Snow-Throat. The city itself has rebuilt since the Civil War and Plague two hundred years ago, during which the city itself was subject to severe deterioration. Much of the new construction is done in the neo-Atmoran style that has become popular across Snow-Throat and Wrothgaria: structures built of massive blocks of stone, monoliths lifted into place with magic, pulleys and lines and set without mortar, then carved with intricate bas-reliefs. Snake emblems are particularly popular in Windhelm, a fad not commonly shared by the rest of the nation. The Hall of the Moot is perhaps the best example of this neo-Atmoran style: constructed at a massive scale to allow giants to attend, the Hall resembles a massive longhouse, or perhaps a ribcage, at the conflux of the White and Yorgrim rivers.</p> <p>Ouada Isra - River Row - is the Dunmer district of Windhelm, and one of the closest to the docks. The largest single Dunmer community in Snow-Throat, Ouada Isra\u2019s oldest denizens are among the first members of the Dunmer diaspora. Younger Dunmer are later immigrants to Snow-Throat, alongside an increasing native-born population, as well as transient traders and merchants from Resdayn. Few of Ouada Isra\u2019s citizens still hold to their House identities - particularly ex-Hlaalu Dunmer.</p> <p>Windhelm\u2019s port and the White River estuary are Snow-Throat\u2019s primary gateway to the rest of Tamriel. The mouth of the river remains, if not free of, then mostly clear of ice year-round - ice-breakers and sweeper ships diligently clearing paths through the winter months. Most traffic in the port comes from Resdayn, grain barges and cargo ships ferrying much needed foodstuffs from Snow-Throat to Resdayni cities. Wheats, ryes, and potatoes from the Commonwealth have found their way into Dunmeri cuisine, making up for Resdayn\u2019s own lack of arable land. Relatively little of what Resdayn buys in Windhelm comes from Eastmarch itself, instead being shipped downriver from Whiterun. Windhelm\u2019s own farms tolerate the cool climate passably well. Summer snows, a rarity in ancient times, have become increasingly common, as squalls from the Sea of Ghosts deposit thin coatings of snow along the coast. Counterintuitively, many farmers claim that these brief bursts of snow aid their crops, a \u201cpoor man\u2019s fertilizer\u201d in addition to the fertilizers bought from Winterhold.</p> <p>Windhelm\u2019s port also calls itself home to Snow-Throat\u2019s navy - or what passes for a navy. As with the land-bound militias, the nation\u2019s navy is little more than legalized, commissioned pirates and privateers. While notionally bound to a command structure, each ship is responsible for recruiting its own crew, electing officers referred to as \u201csea-thanes\u201d, and finding patrons for their ships. The Silver Moths sponsor many ships, even those with bawdy names - Dibella\u2019s Hips, to speak of the most tasteful one. In their free time, many of these privateers double as merchants or adventuring vessels, sailing the sea-lanes along the coast, to Solstheim, Resdayn, and even Atmora.</p> <p>Eastmarch Hold is Snow-Throat\u2019s gateway to the rest of Tamriel by sea, and Tamriel\u2019s seaborne gateway to Snow-Throat. For those bold sea-traders travelling west, Windhelm is the second-to-last major port of call and safest anchor, only rarely seeing sea-giant raids and sheltered from storms that wrack the Sea of Ghosts. Trading opportunities here are perhaps the best that can be found west of Resdayn and east of the Iliac League, cargoes of clockwork agricultural contraptions, Dwemer artifacts, Nordic chocolate confections, Giantish carvings, Orcish metalworks, alchemical concoctions, and more, all for sale in the markets. For those determined to enter Snow-Throat, be it for business, settlement, or adventure, Eastmarch\u2019s rivers provide easy access to the interior, for those willing to buy passage on a river boat, and the roads that snake alongside them provide harder access for those who do not.</p> <p>Editor\u2019s note: while it much of the land is still physically referred to as \u201cThe Pale\u201d, it is heavily advised to avoid referring to the hold as such. Doing so may invoke the ire of residents who resent the attempts of the Jarldom of Dawnstar to exert control over what it views as its rightful territory and subjects.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Holds%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20Giant%27s%20Gap/","title":"Holds of Snow Throat. Giant's Gap","text":"<p>Giant\u2019s Gap is one of Snow-Throat\u2019s three \u201cNew Holds\u201d, alongside Ilinalta Hold and the Aalto. This northern hold is the smallest and most ill defined of all the Commonwealth\u2019s holds, in no small part due to its tumultuous history.</p> <p>What is today Giant\u2019s Gap was once the central portion of the hold of the Pale, administered from the city of Dawnstar. During the waning years of the Mede Dynasty and the Empire, the Pale was headed by Jarl Skald Felgeif, known as Skald the Elder. Skald\u2019s mismanagement of the Hold and repeated pogroms against the Giants (see Holds of Snow-Throat. The Jarldom of Dawnstar) slowly inculcated the secession of the southern portions of the Pale, culminating in a complete separation with Skald\u2019s death in 4e203 and the effective end of the Pale as an administrative entity.</p> <p>The official founding of Giant\u2019s Gap as a hold would not come until after the founding of the Snow-Throat Commonwealth in the late 2e230s. The southern grain-producing towns and hill-forts had developed strong ties with the migratory herder-folk of the northern taiga and the Giantish clans of the mountains during the disorder of the Plague and Skyrim\u2019s collapse, and were loath to join the neighboring holds of Winterhold, Eastmarch, or Whiterun. At one of the now-customary gatherings at Fort Dunstad, representatives of the people of Giant\u2019s Gap instead decided to found their own, separate, Hold, maintaining the independence they had so come to cherish.</p> <p>A depiction of one of the fairs at Fort Dunstad. The human attendees all walk on stilts to put them at eye-level with the giants. Also depicted is a stylized representation of a \u201cVoice-Concert\u201d of the Giantish tradition, in which the singers combine Shouts and music to tell stories and summon windstorms.</p> <p>Today, Giant\u2019s Gap is one of Snow-Throat\u2019s frontier holds, sparsely populated and intensely rural. The hold has no defined northern or western borders, the near-trackless forests and mountains instead serving as barriers between Snow-Throat and the Jarldom of Dawnstar and Wrothgaria. In the northeast, the Tears of Saarthal mark the border with Winterhold, and the Yorgrim Valley of the East belongs to Eastmarch. To the south, the grain-towns of Heljarchen and Loreius on the plains of Whiterun demarcate the southern boundaries of the hold, and protect the few roads that venture deep into the north.</p> <p>Sketches of settlements and nomads. The southern grain-towns are shown to be hill-forts, ringed with high stone walls and gates tall enough for giants to walk through comfortably. Giantish towns in the mountains are built of rough-hewn stone, richly decorated in hides and carvings. Camps of nomadic mammoth and reindeer herders greatly resemble traditional giant camps.</p> <p>Giant\u2019s Gap is the most Giant-influenced of Snow-Throat\u2019s holds. At least half if not more of the population is of Giantish persuasion, and at each year\u2019s Great Moot a majority of the representatives (zul, speakers) of the Hold are Giants. The position of the hold\u2019s Jarl, simultaneously the highest ranked militia officer of the hold, has more often than not been held by a giant, and many of the Mammoth Merchants seen across the North claim Giant\u2019s Gap as their true home.</p> <p>A sketch of inhabitants of Giant\u2019s Gap. Notably, giantish tattoos and scarification are widespread among the human inhabitants of the hold as well as the giants.</p> <p>Despite its small size and remoteness, Giant\u2019s Gap has proven to be an important and contentious member of Snow-Throat. The Jarldom of Dawnstar has long advocated for the dissolution of the hold and return of what it views as its rightful territories, a claim that has been stonewalled by the people of Giant\u2019s Gap. In return, Giant\u2019s Gap has often refused to lend military aid to Dawnstar even in the face of Sea Giant and Falmer attacks, only reluctantly bending to pressure from the Great Moot. Ruins in the mountains have become home to cults and bandit tribes, and Falmer raids have become increasingly common, requiring the posting of militias from elsewhere in Snow-Throat to reinforce those of Giant\u2019s Gap.</p> <p>For traders and merchants, Giant\u2019s Gap is perhaps the least accessible hold of Snow-Throat and has the fewest business opportunities, save for exchanges of art, food, drink, and cultural goods. For the intrepid travellers curious and daring enough to make the trek, however, Giant\u2019s Gap is home to a blend of culture unlike anywhere else in Tamriel, and well worth the trip.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Holds%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20The%20Jarldom%20of%20Dawnstar/","title":"Holds of Snow Throat. The Jarldom of Dawnstar","text":"<p>The Jarldom of Dawnstar, sometimes referred to as the Free City of Dawnstar, is a city-state located on the shore of the Sea of Ghosts, far to Tamriel's north. Once part of the province of Skyrim and capitol of the hold of the Pale, today Dawnstar occupies a middle ground between the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth and the Snow-Throat Commonwealth.</p> <p>The beginnings of this city-state can be traced back to the waning days of the Empire, before the first Great War, when a young man named Skald Felgeif inherited the position of Jarl. A ferverent - some said fanatical - adherent to the hero-cult of Talos, Skald was a rash and militant leader, regularly instructing the guards of the hold and any mercenaries bold enough to carry out pogroms against the giants who lived in the hills and mountains to the south of Dawnstar, railing at injustices real and imagined, and wont to raise taxes and tributes at a whim. The inhabitants of the hold tolerated this behavior, perhaps assuming that he would get himself killed and free them from his rule. Unfortunately, Skald did no such thing, instead defying all expectations and driving out all his relatives, potential heirs, and rivals, and spitting in the face of mortality.</p> <p>At the outset of the Stormcloak Rebellion, Skald, then referred to as Skald the Elder, jumped at the opportunity to prove his and his hold's devotion to Skyrim, Talos, and Ulfric Stormcloak, not necessarily in that order. Too old to take to the battlefield himself, Skald instead took to recruiting - or perhaps press-ganging - as many of the hold's capable hands and sending them to serve in the rebel forces, as well as raising taxes and tributes yet again. Initially accepted as yet another eccentricity, as the war dragged on the consequences readily became clear. Bereft of guards to patrol the roads and man the forts scattered across the hold, banditry exploded, bands of wanderers, opportunists, and would-be lords taking occupying and threatening vital trade routes. The long-suffering giants began to encroach upon the Pale once more, and with few guards left, Skald could do nothing. In the south of the hold, the vital grain-producing farms suffered under the weight of ever-increasing demands for supplies, and food prices rose and rose in the hold's capitol.</p> <p>By 4e202 and the Treaty of High Hrothgar, the hold was in dire straits, yet the Jarl refused to change his ways, instead shifting his attention to jockey for Jarl Elisif of Solitude's hand in marriage in an attempt to crown himself High King. The southern towns, led by the settlement of Heljarchen, quietly began to secede, lacking protection for their homes or the caravans they sent north. Traders, put off by the city's taxes and fees, increasingly began to bypass the port, instead making for the city of Winterhold. </p> <p>In 4e203, after the Tibedetha Incident and the Empire's declaration of war on the Dominion, a tipping point occurred for the hold. Skald, once so defiant of death, was found to have died in his sleep, only discovered due to the absence of his long-suffering manservant from the city. Interred in Dawnstar's Hall of the Dead with as few honors possible, the people of the city took stock of their situation. With no heirs present or even known, the hold was left without a Jarl, and considering the situation they were in, few wanted to become the next jarl. Convening in the Jarl's now-empty longhouse, the city's prominent citizens, businessmen-and-women, traders, and chieftains of the local Danstrar clans elected to form a governing moot, taking decisions in council to attempt to govern the hold and pull them out of the dire straits they were in until a new Jarl was selected. Cut off from the vital grain of the south, the moot instead turned west, sending envoys to Solitude, Morthal, and the towns of the Hjaal River to barter for grain. Deals were established with Morthal and the towns of the Hjaal, and grain barges slowly made their way along the coast to the port.</p> <p>So things continued throughout 4e203 and 4e204. Ore from Dawnstar's mines found markets in Solitude, Morthal, and High Rock, and the Imperial drawdown in Skyrim and the shipments of troops along the north coast temporarily buoyed the coffers of the city. No Jarl was selected, as members of the moot repeatedly blocked each other from attaining the position.</p> <p>It would not be until the next year that the deadlock was broken. A Legion veteran named Brina Merilis reached out to Elisif of Solitude, the de facto Imperial authority in the province, and received her backing, both in the form of a letter of sponsorship and the subtly implied threat of force. Ascending the the position of Jarl, Merilis was nonetheless forced to make severe concessions to the city's moot limiting her powers as Jarl - chief among them an inabilty to tax or raise levies. Merilis inherited a mess of a hold from Skald, shrunken by mismanagement to an area hugging the north coast, low on funds, and nearly cut off from the rest of the province by the slow collapse of trade. But if things seemed poor now, worse was yet to come.</p> <p>Increasingly harsh winters and dangerous seas, beginning in the winter of 4e204-205, began to cripple what trade was left, as travel became unreliable and crops failed. The port of Dawnstar became nearly empty of traders, and locals desperately began to cobble together ships to fish and hunt whales and horkers. Word slowly reached Dawnstar in 4e206 of plague in the Niben and the battlefields of the Second Great War, and by 4e207, plague in High Rock completely cut off western trade. Fearful of plague and desperate for survival, the Jarldom hunkered down, settling down for the long and confusing plague years to follow.</p> <p>After 4e207, the records of the city become scant. With little to no paper, no printing press, and limited access to parchment, written records are scarce. Oral history recounts that the city managed to maintain intermittent trade with Morthal, bartering ore, meat and blubber from horkers and whales, and fish for grain. The expedition to the Pillar of Thras in 4e219 appears to have anchored in the port, bringing word from both Winterhold and Solitude. Outside of this, little is known about what happened in the beleaguered city-state until 4e242.</p> <p>In this year, traders from the Port of New Winterhold in the burgeoning Snow-Throat Commonwealth visited the city, making their way through seas littered with icebergs to drop anchor in the port. They found that the city had little use for the coins and gems they brought, instead preferring to barter for goods, trading for trinkets and food. Departing back to New Winterhold, the traders brought word to the elected Jarl of a city headed by a Jarl and Thanes, with a chapel devoted to Stendarr instead of the Nordic twins of Stuhn-and-Tsun. After some debate at the Great Moot - then held in the city of Windhelm - an invitation was extended to the city-state to join the Commonwealth, only to be summarily refused. The Jarldom preferred its ties to the west, and the aristocracy feared a loss of power, as the Commonwealth had abolished the nobility within its borders.</p> <p>Today, the Jarldom of Dawnstar has strong ties to both the east and west. The city is not officially part of the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth - the Jarl holds no writ of taxation from the queens - yet the travelling court has been entertained in the city. Representatives from the city's moot, and occasionally the Jarl, will travel to the Great Moot from time to time to debate and press issues - finding unlikely allies in the Counts and Countesses of Bruma. Propositions to join the Commonwealth have been vetoed by the hold of Giants' Gap, formerly the Pale, dominated by giants with long memories of past injustices, and complicated by the refusal of Dawnstar to accept the hold as an independent entity. Nonetheless, covens of Fryse hags watch the coast, and agreements of mutual defense have allied the Jarldom's fyrds with the Commonwealth's militias against sea-giants and Falmer alike.</p> <p>For traders braving the Sea of Ghosts, Dawnstar is a minor port. Barter and coinage mix in the port, as coins from the east and trade from the west pass through. The port offers safe haven from the icebergs and sea-giants, and less piratical taxes than the fishing villages of the Commonwealth, yet also offers far poorer trading opportunities. Goods from the Kingdom, Snow-Throat, and even Resdayn may be found here, but may be found more safely elsewhere.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Holds%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20Winterhold/","title":"Holds of Snow Throat. Winterhold","text":"<p>Winterhold is the northernmost of the Commonwealth\u2019s holds, a rugged, frigid land bordering the Sea of Ghosts. Cool in the summer and brutally cold in the winter, most of the population are fishers and whalers, their villages built in sheltered bays and inlets. Some eke out a living in the mountains, nomadic herders herding their small, sturdy goats from pasture to pasture. The last of the population lives in the sister cities of Old Winterhold and New Winterhold, site of the College of Old Winterhold and one of Snow-Throat\u2019s two port cities.</p> <p>Winterhold\u2019s south is dominated by the Tears of Saarthal, a sparsely inhabited mountain range that shelters the interior from the blizzards of the Sea of Ghosts. The southern faces of these mountains are inhabited by nomadic herders, bringing their shaggy goats from pasture to pasture, descending into the forests of Eastmarch and Giant\u2019s Gap during the winters. The mountain range itself has few habitations - mainly militia forts atop passes, hermit shacks in sheltered crags, and in the north, a monastery beneath Azura\u2019s Statue. </p> <p>North of the Tears stretch vast expanses of tundra and glacier. Once, the slopes of the Tears  blossomed green in summer, and herders from the coastal villages shepherded their charges to pasture. Today, the land is drab under skies of constant gray - even in summer the temperatures scarcely reach above cool into warm, and drizzling rain is almost ceaseless. By winter, blizzards roar in from the Sea of Ghosts, forcing the fishers and whalers of the coastal villages to shelter for months on end. Ancient ruins lie scattered in the ice and snow - the ancient Dwemer city of Alftand, the Magnarite hermitages of Saarthal, and even places older and more unknown.</p> <p>East lies the remainder of Winterhold. Some measure of warmth from Resdayn appears to help moderate the temperatures of Snow-Throat\u2019s eastern coast - from Hsaarik Head to the White River Estuary the land is cold but far more habitable than the north. Summers have moderate warmth, allowing trees to grow along the bluffs of the coast, and while few crops other than snowberries are cultivated here, more are grown than farther north. The fisher-folk that live along the coast make a merry trade in potash and soap made from seaweed, as well as whale-blubber and meats.</p> <p>Hsaarik Head and the Broken Cape are the northernmost point of Winterhold and the Commonwealth. Here lies the twin cities of Winterhold - the College of Old Winterhold and the Port of New Winterhold.</p> <p>The College of Old Winterhold occupies the cliffs of Hsaarik Head. Centered around the College itself, the city holds what remains of Winterhold after the Great Collapse - an assortment of houses, shops, and taverns, now expanded greatly to provide housing, food, and drink (especially drink) to the myriad students and staff of the College. Here, mages, clever men, wise women, spellswords, mystics and mundane researchers, engineers, and scholars mix - the College, conservative as it is compared to institutions elsewhere in Tamriel, remains the North\u2019s primary center for magic and learning, attracting students from all across the Commonwealth, Wrothgaria, and even Resdayn.</p> <p>The Port of New Winterhold sits on the coast below the College, a scant mile\u2019s walk along well marked and maintained roads. In the early 4e200s, the first permanent buildings of the Port were made from beached ships, turned so their keels were to the sky in the old Nordic style. In the years since, the port has expanded and become more permanent. Most construction is long and low, multilayered walls of wood, insulation and stone build to keep warmth in and cold out. Much of the once-treacherous approach to the shore has been cleared to provide ships a way into and out of the Port\u2019s sturdy encircling walls, and the harbor deepened. Most recently, construction on two squat towers has begun - crank towers for a great bronze chain, to be raised at the first sight of sea-giants.</p> <p>For the faithful, Winterhold holds a decent few religious sites. The Port and College have a multitude of shrines dedicated to the Knowledge Gods  - Jhunal, Orkay, and Mora - whilst many Dunmer from Resdayn and Snow-Throat visit each year to make pilgrimages to the Statue of Azura. For the more secretive, the Magnarite hermitages of Saarthal beckon, though what worship is done there is not spoken of.</p> <p>While some may scoff at the trade opportunities in Winterhold, bold traders have found the journey worthwhile. Enchanted items from the College, tomes of knowledge, whale oil, soaps, and fertilizers may be found here, to say nothing of the less common artifacts from Atmora that have begun to find their way back with the Commonwealth\u2019s expeditions, and even bits of stalhrim and ebony, though at high prices.</p> <p>For the brave few westbound traders, the Port of New Winterhold is the last major safe harbor along Tamriel\u2019s north coast. Villages along the coast may provide some shelter, and the Jarldom of Dawnstar represents a midpoint between the Commonwealth and the Kingdom, but the journey is long and arduous.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Lake%20Malazar/","title":"Lake Malazar","text":"<p>Travelers braving the wilds of Craglorn may find themselves encountering a landmark not noted on their maps - a great salt lake to the northwest of Belkarth. The reason that this lake, named \u201cLake Malazar\u201d by the locals, has not been described on maps before is simple: due to the salinity of the water, it has never been considered an important location, as it cannot be used for drinking.</p> <p>The lake\u2019s north shore is claimed by Orsinium, where travelers may find some form of hospitality. It is strongly recommended for those who may be in the area to seek shelter inside of Orsinium\u2019s borders: the contested territory outside of the Orcish state is home to even less friendly nomads and horse-borne raiders. Once beyond the line demarcated by Orcish airships, seek out the nearest settlement, do not brandish arms, and bring payment or trade if possible.</p> <p>This region of Orsinium appears to be primarily inhabited by two peoples: the Osh Ornim, or Iron Orcs, and the Mantikora, who refer to themselves as the \u201cNu-Folk\u201d. Osh Ornim appear to be the more populous of the two, possessing settlements along the rivers that feed Lake Malazar and deeper \u201cinland\u201d from the lake to the Dragontails. The Nu-Folk, in contrast, have their habitations along, and in some cases, in, the lake itself. These great chimeric creatures seem perfectly suited to the salty waters of the lake, apparently being able to drink its waters with no harm, similar to species of reptiles observed in Topal Bay.</p> <p>Trade with the Nu-Folk of the region may often yield peculiar and rare goods. Lake Malazar hosts an ecosystem unlike any other known in Tamriel, replete with species of stork-like insects, water skimmers, hexapodal salt-frogs, massive brine shrimp, and other, as-yet unnamed creatures, many of which are fished and hunted by the Nu-Folk with spears and tridents. Craglorn itself is home to a veritable menagerie of creatures hunted and herded by the Nu-Folk and Osh Ornim alike, for meat, hide, and alchemical ingredients: clawrunners, wild yaks, welwas, guzzards, wormmouths, dwarf mammoths, giant salamanders, wamasu, and small, shaggy goats, to mention a few. Alchemical ingredients derived from these animals will often fetch high prices elsewhere in Tamriel due to their relative scarcity, though merchants should be prepared to buy them at similarly high prices from Orsinium\u2019s own sellers.</p> <p>It is recommended that travelers through Orsinium\u2019s territories make for Dragonstar as their next stop, avoiding Yokedate-claimed regions that see raids by Bjoulsae horsemen and seeking to return to relatively civilized areas as soon as possible.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Museum%20of%20Aldmeri%20Sapience/","title":"Museum of Aldmeri Sapience","text":"<p>The Illuminated Museum of Aldmeri Sapience in Lillandril is once again open to the general public, so that, in the words of the Museum curators, \u201cwe may show others the brightest aspects of Ehlnofey culture in the hopes that they, too, may strive for a higher excellence in all aspects of Mundane life.\u201d The Museum is dedicated to all the various \u201cChildren of Aldmeris,\u201d i.e. the various Elven cultures of Tamriel. </p> <p>The Altmeri exhibition is, naturally, the grandest. Silvery ancient statues of adamantium depicting Torinaan the Foresailer, Phynaster the Guardian, and other Merethic-era cultural heroes line the walls. Bones of the extinct welwas and ilyadi are displayed as examples of the beasts conquered to make Altmeri society possible. Most popular is the Hall of Rulers displaying a long row of every monarch who ruled Alinor from Auri-El to the Thalmor, crafted with excruciating accuracy in glowing malondo stone. Observing the large crowds that throng to this particular attraction, one is struck by the revelation that Alinor's people still long for the firm but loving rule of ancient noble families despite their modern pretensions of \u201cequality.\u201d </p> <p>The final room of the Altmeri section of the Museum is a showing of modern art from across Alinor - hand-selected by the Sapiarchy, of course. A large mural by an artist from Belport depicts Syrabane driving away the Thrassian Fleet with a flick of the hand, while a culanda-sculpture from Alinor City depicts Anuiel smiling down on the College of Sapiarchs. The sole contribution from Rellenthil is the most controversial, only admitted after lengthy debate. It is a painting that depicts the final members of the old Thalmor regime cannibalizing each other in Alinor Palace. Not very suitable for the family-minded traveler. </p> <p>The Bosmer exhibition is more of a public menagerie containing flora and fauna imported from Malabal Tor. The artist responsible is quite proud of her seemingly miraculous feat in eco-engineering, even if Green wardens must be on constant standby to prevent the predatory animals from endangering visitors. </p> <p>The neighboring Ayleid exhibition is also grand in its own way, as the tall arches, pure white walls, and graceful columns immediately transport visitors to one of the ancient cities of the Saliache. Lit only by welkynd stones, scenes unfold in sculpture and bas-relief of the Ayleid Empire\u2019s rise in the Heartland, corruption by the Daedra, and ultimate collapse by their own hubris in relying on slave labor. The revivalists of modern times are also given a nod of recognition at the end, a diorama of Miscarcand being rebuilt by Bosmeri and Khajiiti laborers is the final focal piece. </p> <p>The Dunmer section opens in an elaborate chamber of wall-sculptures depicting the early Chimer casting off their calians and kneeling before the Three Good Daedra. The center of the chamber is a green-glass statuary scene of Veloth meditating below the Crystal Tower, Boethiah whispering into his ear. In the next rooms house artworks from the Potentate and Resdayn: Ashlander bone jewelry, carapace carvings in the Native Chuzei style, and a topiary of the Empress Katariah adorned with black roses. </p> <p>The cold chamber that is the Falmer exhibition contains ice sculptures of the Aedra weeping (with self-regenerating enchanted tears) as they watch arcano-projections of the great Snow Elves battling hairy barbarians wearing Dragon-totem necklaces. The faithful reenactment of the fall of the Snow Prince is quite a hit with military enthusiasts. </p> <p>A small Dwemer exhibition is the humblest room of the Museum, Alinor not having much access to the artifacts of that vanished race. The usual coherers and puzzle cubes are on display, but the star of the show is a small duplicate of Numidium. Beloved by children, this tiny automaton was to blame for the Museum being closed for a time. Little Numidium (as the locals call it), used to walk about on a map of Tamriel on the floor. This feature had chronopathic side effects on those who gazed at it for too long, thus it was disabled. While the Museum of Aldmeri Sapience does not feature a gift shop, parents may be delighted to know that one of our sponsors, the Saint Kagrenac Corporation, sells working (and completely safe!*) Little Numidiums at reasonable prices by mail or at one of their shops near you. If Dwemer imitations you lack, go see Saint Kagrenac!</p> <p>The other small exhibits are a room of coral serpent totems from the Maormer, a room of ancient Trinimac votives from Wrothgaria, and (somewhat controversially, given their debated heritage,) banners of the Goblin Welkynars from King\u2019s Haven. </p> <p>One more exhibition, simply titled \u201cThe Future,\u201d features arcane projections of the Sunbirds of Alinor flying across the Aurbis to explore and study the Eight Planets. Project God-Reaching, as it has been called, is the passionate undertaking of a handful of Sapiarchs hoping to prove at last the \u201ctrue\u201d nature of the Divines. The program is still in the early stages, but interest has grown significantly in recent years. </p> <p>^(*The Saint Kagrenac Corporation is not legally liable for any lost memories, lost sense of time, visions of the future, visions of the past, visions of alternate timelines, or existential crises that may result from exposure to Dwemer reproductions.)</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/New%20Ayleid%20Cities.%20Old%20Silvenar/","title":"New Ayleid Cities. Old Silvenar","text":"<p>The New Ayleid city of Old Silvenar, nestled on the banks of the Xylo River in the central Malabal Tor, is the political center of the Imperium. The city is an eclectic arrangement of Greenist treepod-houses wrapped around rising spires of Ayleid marble and Dawnway crystal. The Revivalists love to build vertically, a physical manifestation of their fixation on all things Heavenly, and this place is no exception. </p> <p>The ground level, \u201cDirt Town\u201d as the locals call it, is the dwelling of the craftsfolk, artisans, and petite-merchants of the Imperium; \u201cplebeians\u201d in the terminology of their overly formalized hierarchy. An East Empire Company office building can be found on the docks on the east side, near where you will likely arrive. Just across the street is the Xylo River Caf\u00e9, one of our sponsors, offering esteemed authentic Bosmeri delicacies such as jagga tarts, blood pudding, and the finest civet coffee in all of the Sacred Wood! On the west side of the city are the marble halls of the Silvenar Arena, a grand source of entertainment for people across Tamriel. The children love to watch the timber mammoths perform, though the gamblers come for the flying jousts and chariot races. Both the Green and the Silver teams are funded by wealthy patrons in the Imperium, with successful hippogriff-riders hoping it may be their chance to gain sponsorship and advance the social hierarchy.^(1)</p> <p>\u201cGreen Town\u201d is the next level up, where the aforementioned traditional treepod houses share space with Ayleid apartments of mirror and marble. The people here mostly belong to the Questing Knights, though some uplifted Plebeians and various servants also walk the amber streets. Flaunting wealth from their latest ventures is a favorite pastime for Ayleid Knights, perhaps something they learned from their Colovian neighbors, and they import fine silks from Resdayn and culanda-jewelry from Auridon in an unending pursuit to outdo each other^(2). The center of this district is the local forum, where the lower citizens meet to discuss philosophy and cast votes on purely local affairs for the city. </p> <p>\u201cSky Town\u201d is the highest part of Silvenar, where the Temple of El-Adamath sits at the nexus of the many strings of amber and crystal persuaded to sing the color of the Stars. In the surrounding plaza shining marble manors house delegates representing each of the Adoni Welai *(\u201cHeavenly Lords\u201d), as well as numerous Chaplains from across Sunnamora. They discuss, under the Light of the Magna-Ge, the affairs that affect the whole of the Imperium, and receive ambassadors from across Tamriel. Yes, even an embassy from our own Elder Council has a spot in this majestic assembly. We are working tirelessly to advocate for greater democracy and human rights in this young nation, and hope increased trade with Nibenay may encourage such ideals.^(3)</p> <p>Finally, below the earth is \u201cRoot Town,\u201d a series of tunnels branching out from below the eponymous graht-oak located on the southern outskirts of the city. Here the mortal Silvenar lives among the lowest poor and the Green Pact purists. He occasionally makes the trip upwards, to inform the Adoni and the Chaplains\u2019 delegates the will of the people, and remind them of the Way of the Green. The Old Silvenar\u2019s warnings apparently fall on deaf ears, if some are to be believed. In the Adoni\u2019s defense, this Silvenar's legitimacy has long been in question: there has not been a handfasting ceremony since before the Bloodtoil Uprising, and the current title holder refuses to perform one on account of the current Green Lady\u2019s alleged transgressions against the Green Pact. For millennia, that very ceremony was considered symbolic of the marriage between Bosmer and Green, proof of Y\u2019ffre\u2019s divine presence. Is it any wonder, then, that so many Bosmer have since been in search of a new spiritual identity? Nevertheless, the Silvenar\u2019s influence is still nothing to be ignored, and the Green/Dawn divide could become a serious source of tension if cooler heads do not prevail.^(4)</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>^(1)The behind-the-scenes info about arena performers is less glamorous than the showboating would lead you to believe. They\u2019re all bound by unfair contracts owned by their patrons, the main financiers of the Green and Silver teams. Even the equipment they train with and the animals they use are \u201crented\u201d from their supposed benefactors. Actual \u201cascension by victory\u201d is rare, that\u2019s the truth of it. I feel bad for the poor saps being strung along, making money for their mage-overlords by entertaining the masses while barely seeing any of it themselves.</p> <p>^(2)Doesn\u2019t sound that different from the Kragenmoor Gala held by House Hlaalu every year.</p> <p>^(3)More likely, working to prevent the Bank\u2019s investment from going under. Didn\u2019t the Thalmor leave this city a burning hole in the ground? How is this \u201cmajesty\u201d even possible financially? Magic or not, these Ayleids have to be running up a big debt; and I want to know what the moneybags in Stirk and the Elder Council hope to gain in return.</p> <p>^(4)Enough of this bull. It\u2019s not as if every conflict outside of our \u201coh-so-enlightened\u201d Second Potentate is just religious in-fighting or ethnic tension. According to a Khajiiti Ayleid who had no dog in the race, the real problem is that Greenspeakers and Treethanes used to be leaders of these sorts of communities. Then the \u201cNew Ayleids\u201d came along and now suddenly war-wizards and astrologers are the ones calling all the shots. It\u2019s about power, not just religion.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/No%20Shira%20Citadel/","title":"No Shira Citadel","text":"<p>Located on the southern shores of Hew\u2019s Bane, the No Shira Citadel is the chief training complex of the sizable mercenary guild that is the Order of Ebonarm. Warriors from all over the West come to train here; some will become \u201cBlack Knight\u201d sellswords in service to the at-Reymon Family, others will become dragonknights of Abah\u2019s Blades, and some will become sword-singers of the Totambu Yokedate. All will have earned a ferocious reputation the ancient Citadel accrues them.</p> <p>No Shira, built by Prince Hubalajad during the Tavan Wave, has changed leaders countless times since the First Era. By the time of the New Warrior Wave, it was under the control of an eccentric hybrid organization born from the alliance of dragon-hunting Blades and Thalmor-hunting Remnants. Abah\u2019s Blades, as they were dubbed by their critics before they reclaimed the insult as a point of pride, were initially firm supporters of the Totambu Yokedate. Everywhere the Wave went, Citadels of Ebonarm were rebuilt or converted from Fighters Guild halls.</p> <p>In time, the Citadels had become the most influential mercenary network in western Tamriel, and the Emperor wanted a share of this wealth. He declared Ebonarm a \u201cfalse god\u201d of Breton origins, using this claim to justify taxing the Citadels. The Grandmaster Hajar \u201cat-Reymon\u201d responded by seceding from the Old Kingdom, claiming Abah\u2019s Landing, and forming an alliance with Firsthold. Craftily, she still paid tribute to the Elden Yokeda and accepted the presence of a symbolic Yokeda within the city. Thus a handful of Citadels in Yokedate territory where the Emperor's influence is not as strong were able to keep their doors open without paying hefty taxes to Hegathe.</p> <p>Warriors training at the Citadels who do not swear service to a Yokeda or join the Abah\u2019s Blades are eventually expected to begin their Walkabout, which the at-Reymons interpret as an eternal quest of self-improvement. They take only contracts they believe align with their so-called \u201ccode of honor,\u201d and at prices much higher than the Fighters Guild. So obsessive is their fixation with honor that their ranks are filled with reckless sellswords seeking a \u201cglorious death\u201d on the battlefield. The sword-singers lucky enough to survive into old age become Battlemasters, heads of their own Citadels, and are often adopted into the leadership of the at-Reymon Family. While some may balk at the idea of \u201chonorable\u201d assassins and cutthroats, it should be remembered that the Citadels emphasize Ebonarm in his aspect as \u201cthe wandering Black Knight,\u201d righting wrongs, destroying evil, and keeping the peace. They are therefore oddly similar to the Morag Tong in their self-justifying mythos as keepers of the peace preventing greater bloodshed.</p> <p>The Sword-Saint shrines of No Shira Citadel are the most popular site in the region; visited by pilgrims from various faiths and backgrounds. The Yokudan shrines of Frandar Hunding, Divad the Singer, Makela Leki, and Gaiden Shinji. The Akaviri shrines of Renald the Skin-Changer, Sai Sahan, and Delphine the Serpent-Slayer. There is even a shrine to the Altmer warrior Torinaan the Foresailor. Many young initiates pray that one day their sword will join those of\u00a0warriors past which hang on the sacred walls.</p> <p>There is a dark undercurrent to the at-Reymon Family\u2019s mercenary society. Part of the alliance between Firsthold and Abah\u2019s Landing was a pact which made Abah\u2019s Blades the black operations force of the Republic, performing secretive murders on Freehold\u2019s enemies that are always dressed to look like accidents or convenient coincidences. Small villages are extorted, foreign caravans and merchants are butchered, political dissidents are made to \u201cdisappear.\u201d Perhaps the legends of their honor should finally be put to rest.</p> <p>........</p> <p>Sailing around Tamriel means I've met warriors of all stripes. Redoran watchmer, Orc berserkers, Nord militia, Breton knights, Nibenese Battlemages; they all talk about \u201chonorable deaths,\u201d especially the younger ones drunk on old war stories or the old-timers looking for a legacy to leave behind. They all claim some righteous code of honor to justify what they do, but your average grunt doesn't obsess over it. These Ebonarm mercs aren't special in that way. They are expensive, from what I hear, but I\u2019d hope that translates into better pay than what the some outfits offer these days. </p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Other%20Lands.%20Blackreach/","title":"Other Lands.

As such the Skyrim Commonwealth has put in place a policy of systemic collapse of any tunnel leading into Blackreach. The Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar and the Karth, by contrast, has decided to exploit the mineral resources of Blackreach, opting to simply exterminate any Falmer camp they come across in their exploration.

Nobody counted the populace, or mapped out the city districts. The locals call it 'Port Topal', 'New Thormar', 'Baan Dar's Gift', 'Father Niben's Plug' (and few variations on this theme, some of them very obscene, and mentioning Helseth by name) and, ultimately, 'Home'.</p> <p>'Tis not a place you want to find yourself in when the cargo on your ships belongs to you. Every port has it's taxes and tariffs, and the merchants often complain of being robbed blind, but this is the only place where...</p> <p>Drat it, I'm tired of copying the high-brow style of the Guide. This is a pirate haven, plain and simple. Their ships would take your cargo, and valuables, and most often your ship as well - but they don't take slaves. And mostly don't execute prisoners. The officers, executives and merchants are ransomed, the simple sailors are offered to join. But, surprisingly, they take no for an answer - except for the crews that run on the Bosmer variation of the creed. Those make you join in place of the pirate you killed.</p> <p>The city itself is sprawling, loud, dirty, chaotic - and peaceful. The fighting in the city is prohibited, and the violence is limited to the regulated and almost ritual Claw-Dance duels. With more than a half of the populace being Khajiit (by my rough estimation), the use of the claws is the norm, and the other races are allowed to compensate with palm-blades or punch-daggers.</p> <p>The political system is a mess - but in an interesting way. I wish I understood more of it, to describe it fully, but the locals are pretty close-mouthed with the outsiders. From what I gathered, the ship crews vote for their captains. The 'ground' crews vote for their captains in the same way, and the city districts are divided between them in some complicated geometry. How the most important decisions are made, I have no idea. There are no uniforms, no crew tokens, no gang signs - only old Thalmor uniforms command instant respect. But everyone seems to know everyone else and their allegiance.</p> <p>Their 'economy' is no less strange, as they seem not to have one. At least not the one familiar to us. The pirates don't use money or barter between themselves, but rather have some sort of credit allocated to a particular crew, with bonuses based on their performance. That means loot brought for the ship crews, but I ain't got the foggiest how they measure that for the ground crews. As a non-violent prisoner, I was allowed to wander around and eat and drink on the credit of the crew that captured me.</p> <p>What else goes into such articles? Religion and faith. Obviously, Baan Dar is a big thing here. It seems that initially, and for the older pirates, it was more of a gag, a way to claim their way of life was a religious devotion. But the longer the city stands, the more serious the cult is treated. Many of the pirates keep small shrines - to their ancestors, to their gods, to the spirits they placate. And the Bandit God is most often present. Usually he is sculpted as a Khajiit, more rarely as a Bosmer. One crew, with a lot of Iliac Bay deserters, had statues of him as a Breton thief.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Locations/Settlements%20of%20Orsinium.%20Dushnikh%20Yal/","title":"Settlements of Orsinium.

Built in the foothills of the Druadach mountains, Dushnikh Yal is the primary point of entry to Orsinium east of the mountains, servicing traders from the Reach, Colovia, Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth, and Snow-Throat.</p> <p>Built in the traditional style of strongholds, central Dushnikh Yal consists of several longhouses that serve as both lodging and warehouses, surrounded by a stone wall of carved stones fitted without mortar. Outside of this wall are what is typically referred to as the \"trader's grounds\" - relatively flat areas in which trade caravans may pitch their tents, park their wagons, and put horses, oxen, and mammoths to pasture. Trade of goods is relegated to the marketplace, where Orcish ceramics, metalworks, hides, and more esoteric goods may be bought and contracts with Orcish smiths and stonemasons signed.</p> <p>For any who wish to travel deeper into Orsinium, guides must be found and hired, as outsiders are not permitted free access to the city-state. Wagons must be exchanged, as Orsinium's roads are inset with grooves of a certain width to help ensure that no carts slip off the cobbles - a safety measure for those paths that travel along cliffsides and gorges.</p> <p>Straying from the roads on the approach to Dushnikh Yal or wandering from the trader's grounds is heavily disadvised. Airships anchored among the crags host heavily armed and armored guards, who will forcefully arrest and expel wanderers or pass word along to the chief of the town.

Unlike the capitals of most of Snow-Throat\u2019s holds, Fort Dunstad is not a city, or even a town. True to the name, it is an old fort, repaired and refurbished, serving as both the site of the hold\u2019s moot and central gathering and trading spot.</p> <p>Giant\u2019s Gap\u2019s hold moot meets four times a year - once in spring, once in summer, once in fall, and once in winter, corresponding to the seasonal gatherings of herders and traders. Four times a year, Fort Dunstad becomes the bustling epicenter of the hold, as people from all over converge to trade, resupply, trade stories and tales, air grievances, and generally have a good time - or at least, a time.</p> <p>Heljarchen, Lorelius, and the other southern communities send grain and vegetables north, to be sold to the villages and clans who grow none. The giants bring their cheeses and meats from the mountains, the lowlanders their snowberry vintages, the herders of reindeer and elk their hides and antler-crafts, the miners their ores and metalworks. Each fair sees the return of many mammoth merchants, bringing with them goods from far afield - County Bruma, the Rift, perhaps even Colovia or the Druadach Kingdom. Bottles are uncorked, fires lit, and the festivities carry on deep into the night, and even through.</p> <p>The most sober - and occasionally least sober - gathering at each fair is the moot. Representatives of the various towns, clans, and camps meet to sit and talk, hearing complaints, writing and reciting agreements, and passing what passes for laws in the wild north. Sometimes the moot finds their jobs easy - yet another agreement to veto the Jarldom of Dawnstar\u2019s entry to the Commonwealth - and other times hard - disputes over grazing rights, passage through fields, assertions to combat strange Orcish cults in the mountains. Those Dragon Monks who make their way north find themselves busy sitting in judgment at these moots.</p> <p>Each winter the moot must select or reconfirm a Jarl of the hold, who will remain in Fort Dunstad year-round. Unlike most of Snow-Throat\u2019s holds, the Jarl is not elected by the populace - not directly, at least. Rather, the Jarl is the highest-ranked officer of the hold\u2019s militias, appointed and confirmed by the moot. In the months when the hold moot is not in session, the Jarl will reign in their stead, commanding troops, conferring with stewards and Monks on matters of economy and state, and more. Most important decisions will be held off until the seasonal gathering, except in matters of extreme urgency - but in those cases, the Jarl must then explain their actions and decisions to the moot when it is next in session. As such, level-headed officers are typically promoted to Jarl - meaning that most often, a Giant will be the head of Giant\u2019s Gap.</p> <p>Fort Dunstad\u2019s remoteness makes it a destination hard to reach for most travelers, but the seasonal fairs are a must for a curious wanderer.

Old buildings either lie in ruins, or are disassembled for materials, most of the inhabitants are busy with agriculture, and those few Qarls the local Baron can feed are patrolling the countryside.</p> <p>A colorful exception to this rule is the city of Rorikstead. The family that holds it, gro-Bleds traces their decent from a distinguished Orcish Tribune from the Falkreath Legion. Over the course of the generations, they managed to employ the fortunate position on the Legion Road to build a city that rivals Solitude itself, and surpasses even Falkreath. Sturdy mortared houses, different from wattle-and-daub or dry-stacked neo-Atmoran ones elsewhere in the province, tall walls, and even a castle-palace that dominates one side of the city marketplace - all of it looks definitively modern. On the other side of the marketplace towers the Temple of Zenithar, courtesy of the Tamrielic Bank of Z\u2019en. The Temple has a complicated relationship with the Archbishopric of Solitude, but its majesty and opulence attracts the flock that doesn't care much for the intricacies of theology.</p> <p>Outside of the city, vast fields grow cash crops that are so in demand among the southern alchemists, and the ever-growing city attracts craftsmen - and also warriors. Gro-Bleds can support a far bigger army than any other noble of Wrothgaria, and they have crafily used their economic and military strength to reinforce each other - loaning money and arms to the other Thane-barons, but also riding to their aid directly. As a result, most of the surrounding nobles owe them in one way or another, giving lie to their direct oath of vassalage to Solitude. </p> <p>Such magnates are not an uncommon occurrence in Wrothgaria - Mallories of Shornhelm, Thirtysticks of Farrun, gro-Khazgurs of Mor Khazgur, to name a few - but gro-Bleds are by far the strongest. Their troops under the gold-horned goat banner, and the troops of their clients, have become synonymous with the safety and peace on the Legion Road, much to the chagrin of Skulnarssons of Falkreath.</p> <p>The current Thane-baron, curiously named Rorik gro-Bled, doesn't hide his desire for a higher rank of an Earl - a privilege now mostly ceremonial, and reserved for honorable but impoverished old nobility like Tamriths or Ravencrones.

Pilgrims from across the Imperium of Sunnamora visit this sacred site daily, but especially on the 13th of Morningstar when the Red Star is most visible in the sky and the Lady of Light is said to be closest to Nirn in her aspect as Harbinger of Dawn. (Some modern astronomers take issue with this claim, but that is a debate for another time). There are two great prayers given on this day: the Morning Star Prayer is celebratory in tone, thanking the Light for banishing darkness. It is considered symbolic of the Dawn of Creation, when Magnus and his children shed some of the Light of Aetherius down upon Nirn. The Evening Star Prayer is solemn and mournful, commemorating the Harrowing of Oblivion by Merid-Nunda. It is claimed that she took pity on the wayward souls lost to chaotic Darkness, and so fell into Oblivion to create the Colored Rooms, a haven of Light in Darkness, saving these souls and adding them to a Collection of the Lustrous. </p> <p>This descent narrative is central to Revivalist theology, wherein it is understood that many Gods sacrificed themselves by \u201cdescending\u201d to Oblivion or Mundus (the two are often synonymous in their sermons) in order to help mortals in some way. Magnus briefly visited Mundus to create Magic, Y\u2019ffre became the first Earth-Bones, Auri-El allowed himself to be bound to Nirn to impart some Order in the mortal realm, and Merid-Nunda descended for the reasons already explained. Controversial as Daedra worship is in Colovia, these Revivalists claim the Bright Lady is not really a Daedra, who are born from the blood of Padomay, but a Star, blood of Anu, and therefore belongs to the holiest sect of Gods. In fact, she is doubly worthy of veneration because she willingly sacrificed her Divine Birthright to offer stability and eternal life to her followers.</p> <p>For the less pious folk of the Imperium, Red Star Day is mostly another excuse for merrymaking. Especially popular is the children\u2019s game of \u201clight-catching,\u201d where in imitation of Merid-Nunda they go running about the darkness trying to catch as many torchbugs as they can.

The High Chapel of Kvatch is still considered one of the holiest pilgrimage destinations by most followers of the Great Dragon, especially as it is the adopted home of Saint Martin the Martyr. However, the interior of the High Chapel divulges a more complicated picture of internal church politics. The old altar to Talos has been re-consecrated to Magnus, and vines have grown along the walls and statuary.</p> <p>After the coup which placed the Ayleid Revivalists in power over Kvatch, the Primate of Akatosh was made a \u201cChaplain\u201d in the Imperium hierarchy. An awkward tightrope-walk ensued, as the Primates continued to insist they were the true heirs of the old Imperial Church, unlike the monotheistic \u201cheretics\u201d of Cyrodiil City, but also begrudgingly acknowledging the supremacy of the Adoni as Defenders of the Faith (much like the Emperors of old). Their acceptance of Meridia worship, especially, has distanced them from the Council of the Eight and resulted in the present situation in which the Primate of Auri-El and the Archbishop of the One have mutually excommunicated one another. All of this may sound rather absurd to you, dear reader, because we in the tolerant lands of the Potentate are enlightened enough to respect varieties in doctrine. To the fractious children of the Colovian West, however, this on-going controversy remains a matter of dire import.

To a learned mind of the Second Potentate, this may sound rather archaic, being a throwback to the Galerion-influenced thinking of the Mages Guild, but in the name of tolerance and compassion we implore you not to snicker at our rural neighbors. The magical reformation is, after all, still a fairly recent innovation in the grand scheme of history.</p> <p>Indeed, let us briefly cast our minds back to the Second, Third and early Fourth Eras. Those periods were dominated by conflict and disparity, when magic was primarily the domain of wizards looking to gain greater power so they may conquer their enemies. It is for that very reason magical \u201cschools\u201d were organized by what a spell effect does rather than where it comes from. Now, after two Great Wars and a world-altering Plague, we live in more civilized times. No longer do we engage in open warfare, preferring instead to resolve matters through diplomacy and trade. The Mages Guild is a thing of the past, and its successors are splintered into factions. Entire new arcane industries and fields of research have been developed, or else more fully invested in than they ever were before. Therefore magical academia has changed to meet the needs of this new age.</p> <p>It was the Conclave of Syrabane in Firsthold which first began to study the esoteric arts according to a more modern classification system: varliance for magicka which radiates down to us from Aetherius, geomancy for magic derived from working the natural world, psychomancy for magic derived the creatia inherent to souls, and of course tonal manipulation for the ancient art of sound magic. Since then other institutions have adopted this list and added to it: the University of Gwylim also teaches auramancy, magic worked from memory, for example; and the Scholar Wave Academy in Rihad have controversially added Flesh Magic to their range of study. Under this paradigm, we recognize that the most important essence of magic is its source, so that it may be better put in an economic and social context. The old-fashioned wizards of the past, working alone in their towers, must remain in the past.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Advertisement.%20Travel%20Notations%20from%20Rivenspire/","title":"Advertisement.

If you would allow us to wax poetic, our vistas are unique for their blend of high mountain crags, rocky shores beset with shipwrecks, and the ice off the coasts.

A careful observer may notice there is no shrine to Auriel and - even more curiously - most of the visitors to the Temple these days are traveling foreigners.</p> <p>The truth is that the Altmer people have become ever more secular over the years. It began in the waning days of the Third Era when conservative Altmer began to adopt The Old Ways of the Psijic Monks in an attempt to maintain \u201ccultural purity\u201d in the face of Imperial rule. Then the Crystal Tower shattered during the Oblivion Crisis, leaving many Altmer to feel abandoned by Auriel to the Daedric hordes. That the tyrannical Thalmor emblazoned themselves with symbols of the Eagle God only cemented the growing disillusionment with him as public opinion slowly turned against their regime. By the rise of the Sapiarchy, most people in Alinor were more interested in the mystical and intellectual traditions of the Psijic than the dogmatic faith of the Divine Prosecution (which would soon be abolished anyway).</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Among the general populace, this looks like veneration of the Acharyai, the oldest spirits which preceded the Aedra and Daedra, and only \u201cfeeding\u201d the positive forces through good works while \u201cstarving\u201d the negative forces by abstaining from greed, violence, and hedonism. The Divines are largely perceived as myth-echoes and divine fragments of Anu the Everything, more cosmic forces than true Beings with will or personality. Most homes now have a family shrine, containing a Divine Genealogy tracing one\u2019s ancestors all the way back to the Dawn. Poorer families or those of mixed ancestry are often unable to acquire such information, however, and so the old divisions between castes still survive in some form.

The region has been home to Goblins for millennia, stone tablets revealing that they were trading with the early Aldmer settlers of the Blessed Isles back in the Merethic Era. For most of their history, however, the Goblin-ken of the Isles were raided for slaves and pushed to the wilderness. Times have changed with the fall of the Dominion.

The Goblins here are more willing to trade than their neighbors, but still seem wary of formal guilds and trade companies; they have even refused to accept multiple offers for a permanent East Empire Company trade outpost. Their government remains tribal and disorganized, the Sapiarchs being largely content to let Goblins do as they please, and so their resources are severely mismanaged. Generational strife is growing as many of the younger Goblins have been assimilating into Altmeri society, moving to the predominantly Altmer cities and adopting the Old Ways. The old-timers fear abandoning their gods will make their children and grandchildren weak when relationships with the Altmer sour once more. </p> <p>The point is this: Goblins in Alinor are much more sophisticated than the barbaric kinds found in Bloodtoil and other wildlands.

Ethnic tensions, religious tensions, economic strain, and the threat of the Thalmor slowly piled up, opening a rift that steadily grew. By the time of the Empire's collapse, Bruma was effectively a member in name only.</p> <p>After the Plague, Bruma found itself an independent city-state like its Colovian neighbors, yet more culturally and religiously connected to the fledgling Commonwealth, sharing the restored Nordic faith. Politically, County Bruma had also seen a resurgence of moots in government, albeit a weaker one wherein the aristocracy retained far more power. To the east, the Potentate loomed, to the south, the Archdiocese slumbered, and to the west, the divides of the Colovian city-states ever deepened. Despite this, the counts of Bruma remained resolutely independent, preferring to treat and trade with the Commonwealth as separate nations.</p> <p>All this changed in the early 4e300s. One spring, a horde of Bjoulsae horsemen emerged from the Colovian steppes, larger than any before, and swept across Colovia, seemingly unstoppable. Desperate, the countess of Bruma sent runners north  begging for aid, praying to Ysmir that the moots of the Commonwealth would send troops in Bruma's hour of need. And the Commonwealth responded - Odahviing himself flew out from Bleak Falls Monastery at the head of dozens of Dragon Monks and two thousand militiamen gathered from Ilinalta Hold. Together, the forces of the Commonwealth and Bruma met the horse horde and threw them back.</p> <p>That summer, the countess of Bruma travelled to the Great Moot at Ivarstead and asked for the Commonwealth to accept County Bruma as their newest hold.</p> <p>Today, Bruma is a resolute member of the Commonwealth. The system of moots has proved popular among the common folk, yet the counts and countesses still hold to their titles and inheritance.

These monks can broadly be separated into two categories: the New Tongues and the Kaal-Drem.</p> <p>These orders both follow the same religion of neo-Ysmirism: a strange, occasionally incomprehensible belief that conflates Alduin, Odahviing, Paarthurnax, Miraak, Talos, and the Last Dragonborn into the deity Ysmir of Many Faces, worldly subgradient of his parents Kyne and Shor/Ald, who incarnates into the world to fight and learn from himself in search of enlightenment. Both hold that their orders were founded by the Last Dragonborn, and tell parables (often contradictory) of the interactions of the faces of Ysmir.</p> <p>The Kaal-Drem tend more towards the monastic side of the Dragon Monks. The majority of dragon monk monasteries across Snow-Throat and on the flanks of the Throat of the World hold to the creeds of the Kaal-Drem. The New Tongues, in contrast, hold more to the warrior tradition, and have fewer but larger monasteries. However, monks of the New Tongues are welcomed into the monasteries of the Kaal-Drem and vice versa, and wandering monks of both lineages will often travel in each other's company, further blurring the distinction for the common person. In theory, the orders can be told apart by the color and cut of their robes and the armor and equipment they carry, but the myriad differences between monasteries, orders, and personal preferences causes a bewildering array of appearances. A monk is a monk is a monk, and when a monk is called upon for adjudication, any will do.</p> <p>The most fundamental difference between the two lineages is their approach to the Voice. The New Tongue philosophy generally rejects the Way of the Voice, instead claiming that the Voice should, and even must, be used for martial purposes, as peace must be protected by violence. The Kaal-Drem, in contrast, hold more to the Way in imperfect imitation of the Greybeards, in pacifistic practice, worship, and self-defense. Both lineages claim the other is fundamentally misguided, and will often have Shouting matches in attempts to prove their points. Such matches are often inconclusive, to the ire of both, and the moral superiority of the Kaal-Drem in following the Way is often rankled by the New Tongues proving time and time again that pacifism is not always the answer.</p> <p>However, not all Dragon Monks are mortals. Some Dragon Monks are in fact dragons themselves, sworn to the Way of the Voice and living in contemplation and seclusion in Kaal-Drem monasteries, protected from the world outside. These monk-dragon Dragon Monks are the patrons of Kaal-Drem orders, teaching their followers the Voice. </p> <p>Nor are all the patron dragons of Dragon Monks monk-dragons. The more active and widely-know dragons in the Commonwealth are the patrons of the New Tongues, sometimes called the Hunters. Led by the dragon Odahviing, these dragons have rejected both the Way of the Voice and dominion over mortals, instead preferring freedom. This has lead to the misconception that all dragons in the Commonwealth are followers of Odahviing, something the dragon himself regards with amusement.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Editor%27s%20Note.%20On%20General%20Attrebus%20Mede/","title":"Editor's Note.

The obscurity of their destination was crucial to the operational security and success of their endeavor. The contemporary consensus that their ultimate destination was Orsinium in the Dragontail Mountains can be best understood as a misdirection, especially since Orsinium has repeatedly refuted the reality of this contingency despite renegade reports to the contrary.

While the exoteric cults are obvious, and many of them in communion with larger Tamrielic society, the esoteric cults are strange and homegrown and often carry a tinge of elitism. An apologist might argue that the hardy people of the Abecean tend to be a more practical sort, that where an Neo-Alessianist monk might seek union with the One through intense meditation and seclusion, a Freeholder instead forms a practical reciprocal relationship with their gods in order to effect some change in the world. However, such manipulations of the world can be dangerous if not carefully managed, and thus only the elect are allowed to enter the upper echelons of these groups after years of proper training and education. Others taking a more critical lens, have claimed that it allows the wealthy elite to maintain a sense of social cohesion and distance from the common folk despite the Republic\u2019s pretensions of meritocracy. Indeed, the cults connected to the patron deities of the resident patrician families are the most widespread (as far as we can know from an outsider\u2019s point of view. Actual population data is, of course, almost nonexistent). </p> <p>Consider the Order of the Ageameld, Xarxite Scribes and Seekers, devout arcanists who are eventually granted the special tomes that have the power to alter reality with a glyph, but also produce mental degradation in an untrained mind. Their order is the most elitist, as only a select few are given glimpses into their grand temple beneath Firsthold\u2019s Great Library, and not many outside their order know the names of their leadership. And yet it is hard to deny that the power of Apocrypha would be dangerous if unleashed upon the masses. When they are publicly seen, Freehold arcanists are usually preparing runes and glyphs to strengthen alchemical ballistae and glass-porcelain torso armor that is common issue among the navy.</p> <p>By stark contrast are the Numantia Sibylli. An order of mostly women in bright lily-covered robes who have rejected the idea that the prophecy of the sibyl should be limited to just one person, or religion limited to any building. Members train themselves to meditate upon spiritual aesthetics and eventually commune with Dibella herself, or one of her Heavenly Nypmhs, allowing the spirit to \u201cspeak through them.\u201d They can be found in almost every port proffering their frenzied prophetic revelations, inspiration for the downtrodden, some of which actually comes true. Yet even they, so it is claimed, have higher membership for those who have perfected their love for Dibella and gained better mastery of the Sight. These high oracles are patronized by the nobility of the Republic, who glean every word for information they hope they might use on political rivals.</p> <p>There are also the Stormwardens. An ancient group to be sure, some claim founded back in the times of the original Ayleid empire, but they have been modulated by Freehold society. Today they are strange animists who join along with many a ship, commanding a storm by calling upon its secret name, or singing to the waves to steer an enemy ship. Some scholars believe that these same storms come back stronger and more ferocious, perpetuating a dangerous cycle. Furthermore, unverified rumors speak of some greater powers hidden away in an elusive underground city, waiting to be unleashed upon Freehold\u2019s enemies should their patrons in the Camoran Family give the order. Pure nonsense, perhaps, but it has found much purchase in the minds of some critics of the Republic.</p> <p>The Phynasteran Preservers are the most obscure. Shrines to the Guardian of sailors and wayfarers can be found all across the Abecean and beyond, of course, but it is also known that higher tiers to the Phynaster cult exist. Mostly found among Freehold naval officers and expeditionary forces, they are said to be exclusive clubs that devote themselves to the model of the God of Journeys, believing each tour grants them a longer life and brings them closer to Alaxon.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Freehold.%20The%20Geowrights%20of%20Zen/","title":"Freehold. The Geowrights of Zen","text":"<p>The Free Temple of Zen in Chasegard houses the headquarters of that strange order of priest-mages, the Geowrights of Zen. Standing before the Temple is a statue of their founder: Soheila Shraj. Though the Patrician Taher Shraj was the one to negotiate Chasegard's entry into the Republic, it is to his famous aunt Soheila that the city owes its relatively newfound wealth and prominence over the neighboring city of Rihad. </p> <p>Soheila showed a talent for magic at an early age, and as soon as she reached adulthood made her way to Cheydinhal to train under the Synod. It was her education in Nibenay that set the stage for her to revolutionize industry in her homeland, yet she did not speak fondly of those days as she disagreed with the old tradition-bound faculty over a number of issues^(1). Chief among them was her concern that mages at the time had been limiting themselves by focusing solely on magicka which radiates from the Sun and stars; was it not true that the entire Mundus was shaped by Magic? Were caves not the very veins of Mother Earth, and gems and crystals merely fossilized spiritus? What of the rich field of alchemical science, so often sidelined as second-rate by wizards obsessed with raw Aetherial spell-weaving? Thus she proposed an entirely new school of magic, Geomancy, combining elements of the old school of \u201cAlteration\u201d with specialized knowledge of alchemy and enchantment.</p> <p>She failed to attract much attention for her ideas at first, appearing at a handful of lectures around Hammerfell and Cyrodiil before accepting that she had failed as an academic and joining the Resolution of Zenithar. Then, the Silver Plague forced a quarantine of Hubalajad Bay. Lord Shraj turned to the merchant-priests of Iron Zen to solve his economic woes, and Soheila finally had a chance to apply her theories. While they could not find a \u201ccure\u201d for the Plague, their advanced knowledge of the alchemical processes allowed them to develop fine treatments, and the ore-based enchantments they produced, while not as powerful or rechargeable as soul-powered enchantments, proved quite competitive in the much more localized markets of the Plague-economy. The Geowrights had even developed ways of locating ores and minerals underground, helping to establish many mines that the Shraj Family still benefits from to this day. Needless to say, Geomancy was now considered a legitimate form of magic, especially among the people of Hew\u2019s Bay, and Soheila\u2019s objections to varliance dominating arcane academia were validated. </p> <p>Today, the Geowrights have taken on a more exclusive attitude - perhaps a holdover of the traditionalist Redguard idea that magic should be heavily regulated by religion, or else a consequence of Freehold obsession with aristocratic hierarchy. Though a research institution first and foremost, their techniques are closely guarded, granted only to members who have lived and trained among them for years. Their leaders tend to come from a long line of merchant-nobility going back to the Forebears of old. Yet their domestic influence is undeniable; their ruby-tipped crossbow stunbolts are standard among the Auridon Paladins, and their emerald-based potions are a staple of Freehold medicine. </p> <p>\u2014</p> <p>^(1)Interesting that Nibenay tries to claim her when the plaque I read says she only studied there for two years.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/General%20Jonna%20the%20Ghost/","title":"General Jonna the Ghost","text":"<p>Heroine of the First Great War\u2019s Battle of the Red Ring, General Jonna was awarded the vampire-vacated throne of Skingrad.

Unlike most of the holds, with the exception of County Bruma, the Jarl is neither elected by the people or selected by the hold moot. Instead, the position of Jarl is granted to the most senior priestess of Kyne in the hold. Whosoever is determined to be both the oldest and longest-serving - often the same - is installed at the sacred grove at Kynesgrove, to hold the position until either death or abdication. Any woman wishing to abdicate the position is required to leave the hold entirely.</p> <p>As a consequence of the mandate that the most senior priestess in the hold is the Jarl, it is typically held that the Jarl cannot leave the hold, else the position be passed to the next in line. As such, unlike most other holds, where two individuals are elected to the positions of Jarl - executive of the hold in the hold - and Harbinger - executive of the hold at the Great Moot - and will switch positions midway through their two-year term, the individual who is Jarl will always be in the hold, and the Harbinger will always be at the Great Moot. Harbingers of the Aalto are often but not always relatives of the Jarl, either spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings, or nieces and nephews.</p> <p>This system has proven to be less stable than one might expect. While insulated from the instability of elections that other holds may experience, there is no guarantee that the Jarl will be a capable leader, or serve for an extended period of time. In the case of one exceptional string of Jarls, a single year saw no less than five women elevated to the position.</p> <p>By far the most remembered consequence of this system is referred to as the \u201cGeriatric Spat\u201d by historians. In 4e326, Jarl Brunhilde, a priestess of seventy-seven years of age, decided to attend the summer Great Moot, ostensibly to speak on a perceived slight to the Aalto by Whiterun\u2019s Temple of Kyne. Returning to the hold, she found that another woman had claimed the position of Jarl - her friend, Guthrun, also seventy-seven. Guthrun refused to vacate the position, claiming that Brunhilde leaving the hold negated her claim to the position, and that Guthrun was in fact the elder of the two, a claim that could be neither verified nor denied. For two and a half years, both women claimed the position of Jarl, bringing executive matters to a standstill and preventing any Harbinger of the hold from attending the Great Moot. Finally tiring of the situation, the Aalto\u2019s hold moot decided to resolve the situation, but not by instituting a democratic election. Instead, the moot dispatched members of the Silver Companions to the Temple of Kyne in Whiterun, to see if the Temple was aware of any priestesses of indisputable seniority who would be willing to claim the position of Jarl.</p> <p>The Temple, bemused but understanding, was able to render aid. A Dunmer priestess by the name of Anareth, indisputably born during the Silver Plague, accompanied the Silver Companions back to Kynesgrove, whereupon she was installed as Jarl and protected from assassination attempts by the Silver Companions. Anareth reigned for thirteen years as Jarl, by all accounts a capable and beloved ruler, until both contenders had died of old age and a suitable replacement was found. Anareth of the Aalto then abdicated the position, declaring her intent to \u201cfinally leave the hold and have a breath of air that doesn\u2019t smell of sulphur\u201d to great applause and laughter from the citizens of the hold.</p> <p>In the decades since the Geriatric Spat, the Aalto has not had a similar event, aided in no small part by the moot declaring that each priestess of Kyne must have indisputable proof and documentation of her age and birth date. As a side effect, the Aalto is now noteworthy among Snow-Throat\u2019s holds for issuing birth certificates for all citizens born in the hold, and Speakers at the Great Moot have seen modest success in encouraging other holds to do the same.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Militias%20of%20Snow-Throat.%20The%20Valtheim%20Shipburners/","title":"Militias of Snow Throat.

The militia traces its roots to the last days of the old Whiterun Hold and the first days of the Silver Plague, when Jarl Balgruuf the Greater of Whiterun ordered the closure of the White River in an attempt to stop the spread of the plague upriver. Asking for volunteers from the guards and citizens of the city, the Jarl ordered the assembled force to occupy the portaging station of Valtheim Towers, patrol the riverbanks, and burn any ships that refused to turn back.</p> <p>The newly created force apparently took to this task with a suspicious fervor, clearing out - or possibly recruiting - the itinerants who had taken up residence in Valtheim Towers, setting up a command structure independent of the now-nonexistent Jarl, and capturing herds of cattle, sheep, and goats to set loose on the pastures surrounding the towers, as well as almost gleefully setting fire to ships attempting passage upstream. While ultimately unsuccessful at stopping the spread of the Plague, the actions of the Shipburners managed to delay it, giving the people of Whiterun a chance to flee the city.</p> <p>Within the first two years of the Plague, the ranks of the Shipburners had swelled from a paltry two dozen to nearly two hundred, reinforced by exiles from Whiterun and Dunmer refugees from Eastmarch and the Rift. The core of this militia remained the initial volunteers, having been elected to ranks of officers, but supplemented by newly-formed cadres of mages, alchemists, smiths, and stewards. The Towers gradually became something of a safe haven on the White River - albeit one with a dangerous reputation among river-boat crews - providing a small island of stability and order.</p> <p>In 4e231, as the Plague began to recede, the Shipburners sent a delegation to the Hold Moot in Whiterun. Consisting of the few original members and newly-recruited officers, the militia secured a position for itself in the newly-reformed Whiterun Hold: an officially sponsored and approved military organization responsible for policing the area surrounding Valtheim Towers. The militia would in theory be subservient to the Hold Moot and elected Jarl, but would have a degree of independence and leeway in recruitment, organization, and election of officers not present in the old days. Since then, the militia has served capably, primarily protecting the portaging paths, riverbanks, and surrounding communities. The militia has never quite shook the reputation of being overzealous hooligans - and indeed, they seem to encourage it, proudly wearing badges and flying banners depicting burning ships framed by Valtheim Towers.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Naval%20warfare%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Era/","title":"Naval warfare of the Fourth Era","text":"<p>Maritime trade has always been important to the economy of Tamriel, but it has become even more so in our current day, to the point that poets have started to refer to the Fourth Era as \"the Age of Oar and Sail\", but with the increase in trade has unfortunately come an increase in piracy and of military struggles for control of advantageous shipping lanes. As adverse to uniformity as they've always have been, each of Tamriel's many peoples has risen to the challenge of fighting over the waves in its own unique way.</p> <p>The increased glaciation of the Sea of Ghosts has been disastrous for the Commonwealth maritime ambitions but has proven to be a considerable boon for dreaded Sea Giants, used as they are to the frigid waters of Rosecrea and Atmora. In order to combat their raids (as well as those coming from Greater Wrothgaria and Karth), the ancient order of Fryse Hags has been given a simple purpose: to watch the seas and use their frost magic to encase enemy ships in ice immobilizing them and allowing the defensers to close the gap on foot. The few ships the Commonwealth still utilize are mostly of the traditional Nord-Atmoran style described below, but a particular innovation is to be mentioned: the sea chariot. As the name implies it is similar to the war-chariots of the Early First Era, large enough to contain only a pilot and a warrior throwing javelots at the enemy, while they buzz around the battlefield like flies. The difference lies in the wheels being replaced by a hull and the horses by a group of tamed horkers.</p> <p>Greater Wrothgaria and Karth continues to use the Atmoran-Nordic design: shallow-hulled symmetrical longships that can easily be beached, sail upriver or be carried to shore by a dedicated crew, often adorned with shields and symbols of the clans or houses of the captain and officers. The crew now almost systematically includes a weather-mage, often summoning a mist typical of the Sea of Ghost to hide the ship's approach. For larger operations, the longships usually accompany two- or three-masted frigates, wrought from Northpoint Harbour, and equipped with the latest developments in arcane weaponry. Less reputable reports make mention of the kingdom's riekr (ice-goblin) baronnies experimenting with ships made entirely out of magically sculpted ice, which are allegedly indistiguishable from a naturally occuring iceberg.</p> <p>The Druadach Kingdom may be landlocked, but it is crossed by two major rivers, the Karth and the Bjoulsae, both of whom are of vital importance to neighboring powers. To defend them, the Reachfolk have erected a system of dams, watch towers and river locks equipped with balistae loaded with alchemical reagents as well as regularly patrol both rivers on canoe.</p> <p>While the merchants of the Iliac League prefer to wage on light, Sentinel-designed ships that can outrun most on the Abecean sea, when the time comes to wage war, the wave-knights prefer to put their trusts in ships that happen to match the traditional image of a knight: slow but well armored and deadly. The seven- (or even nine-)masted galleons produced by Daggerfall, with their thick oaken hulls and their quadruple rows of alchemical cannons, could hardly muster more than a snail pace if it weren't for the concerted effort of entire teams of entire teams of Breton weather-mages summoning favorable winds and currents. Of particular note is Wayrest's recent development of \"Iliac fire\" an alchemical decoction that, when put into contact with air, bursts into sudden flames that neither water nor frost magic seems able to quell. The Leaguers have naturally taken to fill hollow crystalline balls which they fire with abandons on enemy ships, every missed shot creating a floating puddle of flames on the very water, like a vision of Oblivion.</p> <p>True to their traditionalistic politics, the Yokedate fleet remains in the pure Yokudan style that was already in use at the time of the first Warrior Waves, roughly analogous to the Tamrielic brig or schooner, these emphasize speed over all other concerns. They are most commonly used to allow for quick boarding action. As every sailor of the Yokedate is also expected to be a competent fighter, this tactic usually works in their favor. A particular class of ship that is wholly unique to the Yokedate is the Bladeship. Even smaller than the others, these ships dart around battles at breakneck speed making sharp turns (some even alledgedly managing to dodge incoming fire) that would be completely impossible were it not for the storm atronachs bound to the ship by Tavan wizard-priests, so thar they can maneuver themselves close to the enemy and use a spring mechanism to deploy the long blades contained within their hulls to scuttle the enemy. To crew such a ship is considered the height of honor and bravery as a single one may destroy an entire floating fortress, but few survive more than a couple engagements.</p> <p>The Freehold Republic's fleet is a heteroclit mix of old Imperial West Navy ships, Bosmer song-carracks (shaped from a single \"willing\" tree), Forebear-style brigs and moonstone Altmeri vessels. Their main commonality is the used of enchanted Elven sails that somehow manage to use light in addition to wind to propel the ship.</p> <p>The Sapiarchy of Alinor's ships are made almost entirely out of metal, be it moonstone or glass. While conventional wisdom holds that this should make the ship too heavy to float, it appears the magic runes engraved on the hulls reduce that weight significantly, so much so that with a proper wind, the ship may rise above the waters high enough to unfurl its lower sails (but perhaps wings is more appropriate at this point) and sail the very sky, unchallenged except by dragons or sload airships.</p> <p>As the Baandari fleets mostly depends on capture rather than shipyards to acquire new vessels, they tend to consist of an improbable patchwork of ships of all types, defying all attempts at classification. Cunning commodores use this fact to their advantage as it makes their tactics all the more unpredictable by would-be pirate hunters.</p> <p>The Khajiit of Pelletine (those of Anequina tend to use the Imperial-style ships) use \"dancing ships\", characterized by their very high masts which give the vessels an unmistakable swaying under the lightest of breeze. While one would expect the ships to capsize almost immediately, they rarely ever do. Likewise, the catfolk seem immune to the sea sickness that almost invariably strikes down anyone attempting to sail one of those ships. Kahjiit sailors, in particular those of the Dagi and Dagi-raht kind take advantage of this swinging to literally jump unto enemy ships before the enemy could board their own.</p> <p>The Second Potentate exists for the most part alonside the Niben River. In order to keep control of it, they have perfected the form of the shallow-hulled ship with their triremes, both sea- and river-worthy, these ships possess an armored prow, which they use to ram enemy ships, allowing the marines to board in perfect Legion formation, as if fighting on the ground. Potentate marines are also trained for underwater fighting thanks to water-breathing spells, in order to combat Argonian drillers (see below).</p> <p>For millennia Argonians have limited themselves to swamp-worthy rafts and canoes, and ignored the sea, but in the last few decades they have endeavored to build a navy that matches their ambition as a major player on the continental scene. While this has mostly taken the form of reproducing Third-Era Imperial and Dunmer ships abandoned in Archon, Soulrest or Thorn, they have also come up with their own creations, in particular the \"behemoth\"-class: armored warships larger than even the Iliac galleons, filled to the brim with weapons of all kind, to the point it is said that a single one of these monstrosities would be enough to raze an entire city. They are so heavy they require Thrassian gasbags affixed to their hulls to stay afloat and are not propelled by sail or oar but by some unknown sorcery, known to produce noxious fumes and taint nearby water. Fortunately only three are currently known to exist, so expansive they are. In addition the lizardfolk take advantage of their amphibious nature with the use of \"drillers\": lightly armored (sometimes completely naked) divers who swim to the hulls of enemy vessels to scuttle them from underneath.</p> <p>Long a Minor House sworn to House Readoran, the Great House Sadras focused their efforts on maritime defense against Nordic Raiders from Skyrim. The famous insectoid ships of the Dunmer have in fact all been designed and produced by House Sadras (with the odd exception coming from the profane imagination of a Telvanni mage-lord). Seeking to completely secure their position on the great council, Sadras is constently experimenting with new designs all stranger than the next. Of particular note is that to counter the Argonian driller tactic (which destroyed most of their navy during the Accession War) they have taken to employing Dreugh mercenaries, who are even more at ease under the waves than the Argonians.</p> <p>Finally, despite being a completely landlocked country, Orsinium does possess a navy. An air-navy, made of air balloons and small-range dirigbles, all retro-engineered from Dwarven remains. Their main role is to watch over the borders and roads of the kingdoms to spot any incoming threat (nomad armies in particular). This is probably the origin point of the ludicrous tales of Orcs sailing the waters of Oblivion to plunder and trade (likewise the reports of Orcish \"whaleship submarines\" in the Eltheric ocean are surely explained by the tendency of sailors to exaggerate what they witness at sea (such as regular whales) when inebriated).</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Northpoint%20Entertainment%20Guide.%20Honorable%20Writ/","title":"Northpoint Entertainment Guide.

Some are looking to trade weapons, import or export raw materials for them. Some look for mercenaries to hire or want to be hired as such. It may be even that someone is looking for weapon masters and teachers or researching unorthodox strategies and tactics employed in other lands. Whatever your reason, the following text may be useful for you.</p> <p>Of the armies of the civilized polities, the troops of the Greater Wrothgaria and Karth are the least uniform. Iliac Knights may look very different from each other, as they flaunt their wealth on silver-, gold-, and even ebony-worked steel, but they go into battle as an orderly troop of sword-and-shield-armed Spellswords. The Ra of the Yokedate are known for their ordonnances and regulations. And the New Model Legions of the Potentate, with their mixed formations of Pikemen and Battlemages, are obviously at the forefront of military innovation.</p> <p>Not so the troops of Wrothgaria. They look rag-tag enough to equal Snow-Throat militias or even southern pirates. Each of the individual Thanes or Barons - they use the terms interchangeably - is separately responsible for protecting his own land and answering the summons from his liege or the King himself. In each such troop, a Thane, his relatives, and his Qarls are the main fighting force - several heavily armored men and women, more often on horseback than not, with spears, swords, and axes. Old heavy legionnaire armor from the First Great War, thick and reinforced against the Thalmor magic, is still used as a point of pride and legacy. It is often repaired with local iron and worn over a chainmail. Fully locally made armor is much simpler, often made of boiled leather, reinforced with horker bones, hog tusks, and other barbarian adornments. Only the southern baronies are wealthy enough to allow themselves to import modern and well-crafted Iliac, Orsinium or Potentate cuirasses.</p> <p>The rest of the troop - or the Spear, as Wrothgarians call it - are servants, pages, and even peasants, who are still armed, and serve as skirmishers, scouts, and infantry both mounted and not.</p> <p>Opinions are divided on whether it is their extreme powerty, or a desire to flaunt their Atmoran blood, but this low-ranking infantry - and in the northernmost baronies sometimes even the thanes themselves - go into battle barefoot and pantless, with only a chainmail shirt or a padded jack over their tunic. Their weapons are of the same cheap and diverse sort - longbows, Snow-Throat crossbows, axes, and very often polearms that are nothing but sharpened peasant tools on long study shafts.</p> <p>Their troops rarely contain mages, if any. There is a tradition of sending a third son of the family to study magic and theology at the Solitude Seminary, but not all of them are returning to serve their family. And fully ordained priests of the Divines prefer to limit themselves to healing and aid, shunning away from using their magic in combat.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/One%20Church%2C%20Eight%20%28and%20more%29%20Faiths/","title":"One Church, Eight (and more) Faiths","text":"<p>The Cyrodiilic (or Alessian or, formerly, Imperial) Cult has always been a union of eight (and occasionally nine) Churches within one shared roof. Over the ages, its structure and hierarchies have remained surprisingly constant: at the top are the Primates (also known as Archbishops) of each Divine, gathered in the Council of Eight. Each Primate command the Patriarchs and Matriarchs (also known as high bishops) who manage the Faith in a given nation by directing the Masters (bishops) of the larger temples who, in turn, command to the priests in charge of the lesser temples. In those territories where the Faith is mostly absent (such as Resdayn or the Yokedate), missionaries work in a single hierarchy lead by a single Patriarch.</p> <p>Despite this remarkable unity of structure across time and space, there has historically been much theological variation within the Cult, from the Alessian Reforms to the War of Righteousness to the inclusion of Talos as the Ninth Divine. Most recently, the isolation of each Great Chapel during the Silver Plague lead to religious drift both in practice and beliefs. When the Council of Eight finally reconvened, it was evident that a new theological framework had to be created to allow the Eight Churches to co-exist. Thus were written the Paravanian Proclamations (also known as the New Alessian Covenant, the White-Gold Articles of Faith or the Great 4E 282 Compromise). The first of these serves as the creed that all new faithful must recite to enter the Cult. It reads:</p> <p>I believe in the One-in-Eight, Creator of Aetherius and Mundus, and swear to uphold His Order.</p> <p>I believe in Wisdom, the Insight that part lies, and swear to seek Understanding and Truth.</p> <p>I recognize the Shadow-of-Freedom, who lead Divinity into Sacrifice, and the Absent Architect, whose gift of Starlight is two-sided.</p> <p>I believe in Will, the Strength of the Soul and swear to Labor for the betterment of myself and my peers.</p> <p>I believe in Love, the Soul-Binding and swear to love my Other as myself.</p> <p>I give Praise to the Congregation of Saints whose Divinely-inspired lives are an example to all.</p> <p>I give Praise to Saint Alessia, who First Spoke Covenant in Dragonfire, and to her Companions who Guided and Enacted.</p> <p>I give Praise to Saint Martin who Fullfilled Covenant in Sacrifice, and to his Companion who Witnessed.</p> <p>I believe in Joy, the gift of Beauty and swear to cherish the life I am given.</p> <p>I believe in Righteousness, the Shield of the Meek and swear to Forgive the Lost and oppose the Wicked.</p> <p>I believe in Wonder, by whom the World is known and I swear to explore and respect the bounties of Nature.</p> <p>I believe in Balance, the Promise of the Wheel-of-Life-and-Death, and swear to honor my Ancestors.</p> <p>And I believe in Honor, the Law of the Dragon-of-Heaven-and-Earth, our Bulwark against Evil and Daedra, and swear to uphold Faith and Covenant.</p> <p>Several heterodoxic or schismatic churches are known to use altered versions (most often concerning the placement of the praise to Saint Alessia) or add new verses. For example in the Temple of Khenrathi-Tava in Gottlesfront one can hear:</p> <p>I give Praise to the Winds that are what they are, that have ever guided and protected the Mortals.</p> <p>In Bruma, the Great Temple of Ysmir's frontispiece bears the inscription:</p> <p>Zu'u sahvot ko Dovah-ahrk-Joor. Ahrk vahriin grah zu'umaar.</p> <p>And in the Great Chapel of Auriel in Kvatch the faithful say:</p> <p>I believe in Honor, the Law of the Aetheric Dragon our Bulwark against Padomay's chaos and I give Praise to His attendants: Far-Seeing Magnus, Radiant Merid and Verdant Jephre. </p> <p>Despite this compromise, each Church maintains its own specific sets of beliefs. Here are quotes form various Primate expanding on the points in which their particular Church disagrees with the others:</p> <p>Anton Lockwise, Primate of the Order of Arkay, Cheydinhal, Second Potentate:</p> <p>At Convention, Lorkhan lead the Divines into Sacrifice for the Mundus to be made, and from their deaths arose the first generations of mortals. So it is that our Ancestors are our link to Divinity, and by seeking their counsel through the veil of Death, we do not blaspheme but honor them. It is known that Arkay is the favored Son of Aka-Tosh, is the Light of Mundus, and is the Keeper of the Great Wheel of Life-and-Death since the Dawn. Why is it then that so many myths tell of the ascenscion of a mortal to the throne of Death? This is because we are our Ancestors sprung from their deaths. Those tales are but memories of mortals who rejoined the truth of their ancestry, shouldering the mantle of Birth and Death so that they may shepherd us who still dwell below. Thus it is that the Wheel turns: bringing souls back from the dreamful slumber of the Otherworld to the purposeful wakefulness of the Mundus. Thus do we need the counsel of the dead who know more than we and thus must we act to preserve the Balance upon which rests the Wheel.</p> <p>Marianne Ginis, Primate of the School of Julianos, Skingrad, Colovian Estates:</p> <p>The fabric of the Aurbis is imprinted with the pattern of myth. This gives gods and spirits power but, their nature as mythic figures underpins their true worth: as archetypes and examples for us to understand ourselves. Thus excessive worship is redundant and potentially harmful, as it may lead one to care more about pomp and ceremony than the truths embedded in them. As such our reverence for Julianos expresses itself not through idle and rote prayers, but through learning and investigation, for that is what our Patron god teaches. Julianos offers but one true command, to seek wisdom, and thus his precepts are not theological in nature but epistemological. Where others may prescribe duties and taboos, shun certain practices, magics and beings, we do not, for we ask each faithful to construct their own wisdom, and therefore many of our own freely practice the so-called \"black arts\" of Daedra summoning and necromancy, with precaution of course.</p> <p>Maralie Balu, Primate of the Benevolence of Mara, Bravil, Second Potentate:</p> <p>As Nir, Mara begat Creation, and we all of the Aurbis live in the warmth of that gift. Her Love flows from parent to child, from lover to beloved, from god to mortal. It was that Love that Shezarr sung to the assembly of Heaven, for them to beget the Mundus: a Heart for the Mother. Mara's boundless Love encircles us all, from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows, and calls for understanding and forgiveness, for nen oeia ry metana, \"none is wicked by choice\". Thus do we, Her faitful, welcome into our temples all who wish to enter, and so do we honor and know to be Saintly, all spirits, gods and heroes worshipped by the people of Dawn's Beauty. Remember always Mara's first teaching: \"Love your Other as you love Yourself, for only thus shall You and I become We.\"</p> <p>Jo-Minal, Primate of the Resolution of Zenithar, Leyawiin, Ne Qui-Nal:</p> <p>The world arose from the struggle of Sithis and Anuiel, and struggle has defined it ever since. The struggle of Mortal against Mortal, of Mortal against Himself, and Mortal against the World. And so Zenithar teaches us the most important of virtues: Will. It is by the strength of his character that a man may conquer his vices, it is by the strength of his arm that he may till the Land that Zenithar's blessed wife, Kynareth, gave unto him and it is with both that he may protect hismelf and his own from the depredations of evil men. But strength alone is not sufficient, for what use is a beast of burden without the farmhand to guide it? We know Zenithar to be the god who always win because he holds strength in one hand and cleverness in the other. Only by doing the same may you may you walk the path of heroes which is the best way to honor Him.</p> <p>Lalaine Denyan, Primate of the Temple of Kynareth, Sutch, Colovian Estates:</p> <p>When the Divines sacrificed to make the world, it was Shezarr who gave the most, His very life and spark, and Kynareth mourned His passing. Her tears were the first rain and it was them who nourished the world so that the first trees grew. Kynareth cried until Akatosh showed Her the life that they had begotten and Her smile illuminated the Heavens, the first rainbow. Kynareth then made the beasts who feed on and, in turn, feed the plants of the Earth and She swore to protect and cherish those lives forevermore. She gathered the waters of the world into the great seas that surround Tamriel so that none who lived would be forgotten, and she filled the Middle Air with Her breath, which we call the Wind, so that we would always know that She is with us. But the world is a large place, too large for even a goddess to oversee by Herself and so She created Her sons, Morihaus and Mauloch and more, to rule over winds and beasts in Her name. All that we have, from the clothes on our back, to the tools in our hands, to the food on our plates, to the water in our cups, to the songs on our lips, we owe to Her generosity. And so we swear to revere and study Her creation and to go where Her winds carry us so that we may behold it better.</p> <p>Regulus Albios, Primate of the Temple Stendarr, Chorrol, Colovian Estates:</p> <p>The world arose from the struggle of Sithis and Anuiel, and struggle has defined it ever since. All over the world, the meek, the weak and the unlucky are tormented by the harshness of the world and preyed upon by the wicked. Thus do Stendarr command us with His right hand to bring succor to the wounded, the diseased and the dispossed, just as he commands us with his Left hand to smite evil wherever it lurks. Thus are we both chirurgeons and soldiers. Yet, the greatest of all struggles is internal: Eight Virtues shepherd the faithful through the path of just life, but Sixteen Temptations lead into Eight Vices. Only the Divines know Perfection and so we forgive their faults to those who give into Folly, Weakness, Hatred, Despair, Cruelty, Dullness, Greed or Betrayal and bring them peace and healing, this we do even for heathens and heretics, for it is our god's command. But the Eight Vices beget the Four Abominations, who even Stendarr does not forgive: the shambling undead, flesh turned into prison, the parasitic vampire, greed and tyranny incarnate, the savage werebeast who denies his own humanity and their forefather: the fickle Daedra who refused Creation and now only trespass into our World to lead us astray.</p> <p>Farrokh Rajida, Primate of the House of Dibella, Anvil, Freehold Republic</p> <p>The world arose from the mingling of Sithis and Anuiel. Some call it a struggle, but we know it to be love. The Aurbis is a place of love. Was it not love for us that drove the Divines into Sacrifice for our sake? Thus the best way to honor their deed is to love ourselves, and be grateful for the joy and beauty we were given. For the world is beautiful and it is joyful, as are all works of love. Be not ashamed of your passions, great and small, for Dibella teaches they are the Heartbeat of the World itself. We know the body to be the temple of our spirit and so we maintain it with pleasure and exercise, for which god would desire a dull or crumbling temple? Our dancing, feasting, merrymaking and lovemaking are how we thank the Divines. Our singing, Joy-spreading and art-making is how we imitate Them. Our Lady is not blind to the woes of the world, which is why She opens the gates of Her House to all and says \"Come inside. Here you will find rest and welcome, here you will gather your strenghth to face the World anew.\"</p> <p>Hasphat Trieri, Primate of the Chantry of Akatosh, Cyrodiil City, Archdiocese of the Divine:</p> <p>Time flows ever forward, unilinear and unparalleled, from this follows the unicity of the Principal Principle. That It manifests through the Anu-Pado bipolarity is but a false dichotomy which when examined reveals the necessity of Division by way of Archetypal Emanation: Aad semblio impera, dela can carpio semblex. The first level of which being, obviously, the Enantiomorphic violence of the Missing and the Absent, whose localized interferences expresses itself as the Eight Virtues and their exemplar Mantles. That each Virtue contains within itself the seeds of all others is naught but more unrequited proof of the Simian Truth a god may no more be worshipped alone than a severed limb live on. Yet in all the Divines, One stand as a perfect microcosm of Resolved Polarity: the Feathered Serpent of Static Potential, thus do we hold Him in greater esteem for His Motion is the Motion of Heaven and the Promise of ascendant return to the Original I that We all share, be it by Mantle or by Eightfold Covenant, the Star-marked road of Heaven shown to the Pelin-Al-Essia in Red Royalty. And so we say: AKHAT AE AURBEX AE ANU AE AI!</p> <p>Finally, This theological fragmentation necessarily hampered the Great Chapels' attempts to assert their authority back onto the numerous foreign branches of the Faith, who, although still subordinate to them cling to the freedoms they enjoyed during the aftermath of the Silver Plague.</p> <p>In Greater Wrothgar and Karth, the seven other high bishops act as mere advisors to the Patriarch of Akatosh who is so stalwart in his opposition to \"neo-Alessian\" theologies and has such a tight leash on the cult he is sometimes nicknamed \"the Archbishop of Solitude\". Conversely, In the ever-fractious Iliac, Patriarchs vie with each other for influence so aggressively that most Chapels relegate the shrines of the Divines they are not specifically dedicated to to a backroom (none dares yet to defy the Prophet Marukh's edict that \"All Divine may be worshipped in every House where One is\"). This sorry state of affairs has led the Masters of many Temples to act with little-to-no supervision to the point that some are fully schismatic. In the Commonwealth, patriarchs and matriarchs have suborned themselves to the high priests of the Nordic Gods, and so on. </p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Rites%20of%20the%20North.%20Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials/","title":"Rites of the North. Kyne's Sacred Trials","text":"<p>Kyne\u2019s Sacred Trials is a common coming-of-age ritual undertaken by youths in the Commonwealth. While this ritual may be administered by any devout hunter to their pupils, it is most commonly performed - and most formalized - at Whiterun\u2019s Temple of Kyne. Here, alone and in small bands, hunters will be allowed to test themselves.</p> <p>The first, and unofficial, trial is one with an ancient history. The hunters must prove their worth by taking down an ice wraith, either with a weapon of choice or their bare hands, whichever suits them. When this is done, they are seen to have proven themselves, and earned the sponsorship of an elder. Only then are they allowed to proceed.</p> <p>The rite itself begins with the anointing of the hunter with a paste of mixed animal fat and ashes. A symbol is drawn upon their forehead, a binding magic to draw forth animal spirits into the world. The hunters will then be sent out to pursue their prey, trusting to their training, instincts, and the subtle yet undeniable draw of the magic coursing through them. No two spirits have ever been found in the same place, so while each hunter may follow in the steps of their forebears, they must ultimately chart their own course across the land.</p> <p>The first animals that an aspirant will hunt are typically smaller, less dangerous, and able to be brought down alone. Mudcrabs along the shores of rivers and ponds, skeevers haunting ruins and crags, wolves stalking through the forests of Ilinalta, even hardy-footed goats among the crags of mountains. Comparatively easy quarry, for once one has been judged worthy, they will be set to task on more dangerous prey.</p> <p>The second round of trials sees aspirants tested in their ability to cooperate. Their quarries are now larger and more dangerous, requiring the solitary hunters to be solitary no more, and far more cunning. Hunters will be anointed in groups, sharing the same paste, to hunt bears, boars, saber cats and mammoths (not the mammoths of the giants, mind) - all prey that are only hunted alone by the foolhardy. Spears now take the place of bows, and the land itself becomes a tool, as hunters plot out drives and ambushes.</p> <p>The last round of the trials is the most dangerous, and takes the hunters farther afield. Trolls are a common prey, and may often turn the tables so that the hunter becomes the hunted, while horkers, though robust, prove a danger as their packs may converge on the unwary. But the greatest hunt of all takes the aspirants to the decks of ships - here, on the icy waves of the Sea of Ghosts, they must hunt whales with harpoon and net.</p> <p>Such trials have become commonplace across Snow-Throat in the years since the resurgence of the Nordic variety of faith, but are not confined to Nords. Many Orsimer take part as well, alongside Bosmer, Colovians, and Dunmer, seeking to find and prove their worth. Few Giants have seen fit to participate, instead keeping to their own ancient rites.</p> <p>But despite the popularity of the Sacred Trials, some hunters scorn them as archaic and restrained. Instead, the Hunt of Jorrvaskr beckons, with its ancient timbered hall, its pelts and bones, and most of all, the opportunity to hunt the most dangerous game of all - the fellow hunter.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/Scenarist%20Guild%20Newsletter.%20Umbranox%20Manor/","title":"Scenarist Guild Newsletter. Umbranox Manor","text":"<p>This worn and faded copy of The Scenarist Guild Newsletter is dated 15th Sun\u2019s Height, 4E 381</p> <p>I was recently given the rare opportunity to tour Umbranox Manor, located on a quiet hill in the Gold Coast, on invitation from the Free Hold of Anvil in hopes that it would be the beginning of a greater business relationship between our Guild and the City. The villa was built during the Family\u2019s exile in the aftermath of the Second Great War, when the region was under the boot of Aldmeri tyranny. It has seen many remodels and expansions since then, but maintains the illusion of an ordinary if upper-class Cyro-Abecean home, with the same strong stucco walls and relatively flat red tile roofing found in the city below. None of the curving decadence of the Altmeri style has seeped in, nor have the Umbranoxes transformed their home into a small fort as the Redguard merchant-nobles tend to do.</p> <p>My tour guide, a sharply-dressed Goblin by the name of Eusebio, greeted me by the fountain just past the gates. The old fountain is a shrine unto itself; depicting Dibella the Passionate, mythical patron and ancestor of the Umbranox Family, as she holds up a Lily which spills out water into the pool beneath her marble form. As Eusebio explains it, the fountain represents the Umbranox commitment to always fight for the freedom of the people of Anvil and the Free Holds more generally. </p> <p>Inside the foyer stands a life-sized statue of Fasil Umbranox, the first Count Umbranox of Anvil. According to my tour guide, it was Count Fasil who transformed Anvil from a lowly fishing port into the Gem of the Gold Coast by driving out the pirates and investing heavily in infrastructure. Regardless of the veracity of these bold claims (in fact, the city had been flourishing since at least the Second Era, records now show), the gilded statue certainly catches the eye and makes a statement about the history and prestige of the Manor\u2019s owners.</p> <p>The east wing of the Manor held the living quarters, which I was not permitted to see, and Patrician Umbranox\u2019s personal office, which I was also not able to see due to his being in a meeting. I was, however, allowed to visit the Umbranox personal library, filled with a variety of topics from naval history to economic theory to notes on Redguard history. The library is one of the younger additions to the manor, built by the Patrician\u2019s wife who happens to be a devout Xarxite. The mirror-make bookcases from Auridon were a stark contrast to the simple Colovian woodwork which made up the rest of the decor.</p> <p>The next stop was the west wing, with its servant quarters, kitchens, and dining room. I asked how the workers are paid, but my question was dismissed by Eusebio as rude. You may be interested to know, however, that the Umbranox Family are strangely patriotic in their insistence upon only eating local cuisine from Anvil City and the surrounding region. Even the banquet table was cut from the local poplar trees. I happened to notice a portrait of Corvus Umbranox in the dining room; quite perplexing to me. I did some research on the Family before the tour, naturally, but all I could turn up about Corvus was that he was an adventurer who tended to disappear from Anvil for years at a time while leaving management of the city to his wife. Eusebio seemed nervous when I pressed him about it: \u201cHe was a friend to the common folk, cerum,\u201d was all he would confess in the end. \u201cHe paved the way for who House Umbranox is today.\u201d</p> <p>I found that doubtful. When we reached the vineyard in the back, I finally discovered some trace of the modern Umbranox Family\u2019s true founder. It was a bust in Rinaldo Umbranox\u2019s visage, resting on a podium inside a colorful gazebo overlooking the yard. Inscribed was the Umbranox motto, attributed to him: Divines Bless the Patient.\u00a0</p> <p>Indeed, Rinaldo Umbranox was always a patient man. He was not supposed to inherit the title of County Anvil, being the youngest of three children. He instead dedicated himself to managing the vineyard and causing minor scandals at noble dinner parties across Tamriel, establishing a reputation as a spoiled drunk with no interest in politics. When a rogue admiral of the Aldmeri Dominion called Ambalor seized control of Anvil and declared independence from the Thalmor in 4E 206, it was no surprise to some that Rinaldo agreed to surrender to the warlord and renounce all claims of nobility even as his elder siblings fled to other parts of Tamriel and swore they would one day return. (The Plague would ensure they never did.)</p> <p>Though I knew much of it already, Eusebio happily recounted the tale of how Rinaldo accepted life under house arrest in this very villa. When the Silver Plague worsened and lawlessness spread over Colovia, \u201cLord\u201d Ambalor was largely powerless to defend nearby landowners from banditry. It was Rinaldo who had the respect of the locals, who had the connections necessary to quietly settle disputes and offer protections outside the law. I know, though the Goblin servant would not say it openly, that Rinaldo was friends with some of these thieves and brigands, that he brought a strange form of \u201corder\u201d brought about through these connections. Hired thugs would protect some farms, or some bandits would be persuaded to look elsewhere. Rinaldo\u2019s wealth and influence prospered from these connections, and he became a hero to the landowning class. Soon, even the Anvil City Guard was once again in the Umbranox pocket. All under the rogue admiral\u2019s nose.</p> <p>By 4E 230, Lord Ambalor was dead. Eusebio claims the people rose up against him, inspired by the support Rinaldo Umbranox had given them - though the city guard did little to stop the riot. Supposedly, the people demanded Rinaldo be made Count, but he turned them down, insisting that he remain officially nothing more than a simple wine merchant. The Umbranox Family expanded as the Silver Plague died down, offering their \u201cservices\u201d far beyond the local city. They laid the groundwork that made it possible for them to become one of the \u201cSix Families\u201d in this time period. Rinaldo would die just twelve years after the \u201cliberation\u201d of his people, and it is said the whole city stopped to mourn. </p> <p>At the end of the tour, Eusebio thanked me for coming and offered a parting knick-knack: a silver mermaid desk ornament. Apparently considered symbolic of the City itself. He then once more impressed upon me the importance of establishing future business between the Guild and the City of Anvil. I will, of course, leave it up to the readers and the Guildmasters to make that decision.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Ahemmusa%20of%20Sheogorad/","title":"The Ahemmusa of Sheogorad","text":"<p>Travel in the Sea of Ghosts is generally a bad idea.

For one thing, cold-blooded guar wouldn\u2019t take to the chilly air of the Sea of Ghosts. Now the Ahemmusa live on fish, horker, and loot. They sail out in their longships with their witch-warriors ready to sink outlander ships who haven\u2019t paid the toll, freezing the water around the vessel or striking the sails with lightning.

The Nords and the Ashlanders used to hate each other, but necessity is the mother of hatchet-burying. Seems that during the Silver Plague and the Frostfall of Atmora spreading southward, the Sheogorad was isolated from the rest of Tamriel and the tribes were forced to trade with each other. You can see traces of their influence on one another if you know where to look. Sometimes hear Nord warriors praying to Boethiah the Berserker who avenges Shor, and the Ahemmusa witches clearly use fryse magic and Nordic rune-inscribed weapons, even though they claim Azura taught them such things. </p> <p>If the Redoran had any sense they\u2019d get rid of these marauders, but it\u2019s an open secret that the Ahemmusa occasionally raid settlements in the northern Telvanni peninsula, and that the Redoran benefit from their old foes being kept in check.

After the fall of the last bastion of the Dragon Cult in 1E 139, they appeared sparsely throughout history, though they often played significant roles. In the Second Era, a dragon called Nafaalilargus served Tiber Septim as a weapon of the Empire before being killed by the Crown Redguard Cyrus. It is rumored that in the Third Era, a dragon sat in the court of Daggerfall on behalf of the Dowager Queen Nulfaga. Such instances of seeming subordination are relatively rare, however, and seem to be a result of their near extinction at the hands of the Nords. This all changed with the Dragon Crisis of 4E 201. Reports of the event are muddled with rumors and folklore, but what is known is that Dragons began reappearing in large numbers, primarily in and around Skyrim. Many of them were hostile, killing and destroying entire towns indiscriminately throughout the province. However, the cultural hero of Skyrim known to Nords as the Dovahkiin began a campaign of eradication against the wyrms, and appears to have succeeded in culling their population significantly. By the start of the Second Great War, what dragons remained had gone into hiding, and were absent from the battlefield on either side. When the Silver Plague set in and abruptly stopped the fighting, many dragons took the opportunity to migrate and settle across Tamriel with little resistance. They now reside undisturbed in many regions, welcomed by most out of either kindness or fear. Many claim to practice a form of pacifism known as the Way of the Voice, the largest of this group being the Kaal-Drem of Snow-Throat. They have amassed a sizable following, whom they teach in secluded monasteries modeled after the famous High Hrothgar temple. Though they seem peaceful, many are concerned that they are attempting to reestablish the Dragon Cult of old. Even more brazen in this regard is the dragon Odahviing and his cult of New Tongues. He and a small group of his kin lead this terrorist faction out of the Nordic ruins dotted across the region, enforcing their own ideas of peace and justice on the helpless citizens of the Commonwealth. Others still have taken up residence in the so-called Archdiocese of the Divines in the old Imperial City, roosting on the White-Gold Tower and along the city walls. They appear to serve the strange Temple of the One, protecting their sovereignty in what is no doubt a tenuous agreement. There are even rumors of a dragon mercenary in Orsinium, who demands tribute from the locals in exchange for protection. There were, however, those noble dragons who sought to repay their debts to Tamriel. These are the ones who defied the Dragon Cult in their time, or who did not take part in the destruction that was wrought during the Dragon Crisis. Those strongest and most honorable were accepted as soldiers in service to the Potentate, protecting its citizens and keeping peace and order. They reside along the Niben, vigilantly guarding against threats of all kinds, including their savage brethren. </p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Dragon%20Icons%20of%20Rivenspire/","title":"The Dragon Icons of Rivenspire","text":"<p>Presented by: Stace Cacciare, Royal Scribes of Wrothgaria, Rivenspire Chapter</p> <p>The image attached was part of a sermon pamphlet found in the Shornhelm Chapel\u2019s archives, dated toward the end of 4E 233. The symbolic icons of the dragon are sometimes found as a pair, as here; others as just one of the two. These dragon prints are found throughout archives in 4E 233-250 in Shornhelm and as far east as Hoarfrost Downs, but this pamphlet appears to be the origin. Excerpt from the pamphlet is below:</p> <p>It is with great joy that we announce that a child of Akatosh has taken residence at the Doomcrag. You see, we are not the forsaken children in the moors! No, my fellows, the Children of Time are returning to Rivenspire. We now have a protector overlooking Shornhelm to remove the remaining stains of plague. Time does, indeed, heal all wounds.

Your work and labor will dwindle and rust as Time marches on. Even learned theories will change over the course of Time. The wheel moves ever onward.

Do not fail to pay your respects to Akatosh. </p> <p>In the night, I have seen the fires. The fires! Cleansing fires have been seen on the mountains. Woe to the bandits and goblins that remain in the foothills, for they will see their doom in flight. The gold in their purses is, to a dragon, no different than silver on their skin. Both will fall before time and become nothing but dust. The plague will be cleansed by the fires of Akatosh\u2019s kin! </p> <p>Remember that no matter what you have done, it is through Akatosh\u2019s Will and Wonder that the past fades away and you can begin anew. In such ways, we will be born anew. The symbol of that new birth is here. As the plague is burned away, we will find our way again. As much as we have lost, we will rebuild. We will see wonders once more. The end is not here, but a new beginning!</p> <p>Praise Akatosh!

Throughout much of their existence, they operated in nearly every province, and took on contracts freely from anyone who would pay their fee. However, the beginning of the 4th Era saw a sharp decline in the organization, and by the time of the Dragon Crisis the Penitus Oculatus reported that they had destroyed the last remaining Brotherhood Sanctuary. This, of course, was a short lived victory, as only days later Titus Mede II was assassinated. There is debate as to who perpetrated the murder, but the Dark Brotherhood was quickly given credit, and a brutal Imperial inquisition was carried out on any suspected of aiding or utilizing the organization. Despite this, the Empire\u2019s continual mishandling of the matter allowed a small sect of the Brotherhood to begin rebuilding the guild, and by the start of the Second Great War they were utilized frequently to assassinate political or military targets.  When the Silver Plague brought the war to an abrupt halt, one would think that the guild of killers would find themselves largely out of work, as the disease that ravaged Tamriel often did their job for them. Yet their services were still called upon with surprising frequency, and the Plague provided ample cover for an untold number of murders, further strengthening the Brotherhood\u2019s growing foothold. Thus when the Potentate rose to power and began recovery efforts from War and Plague alike, they had the additional problem of a growing assassin\u2019s guild, which continually operated outside of the law, festering beneath the surface of the newly established society.  Esteemed Potentate Helseth swiftly set to work on the issue, creating a specialized military team to hunt down the Dark Brotherhood\u2019s sanctuaries within Potentate territories, ultimately succeeding where the Empire could not and wiping out the organization\u2019s presence in a matter of months. No longer can the profane \u201cBlack Sacrament\u201d be performed to summon a murderer-for-hire. Indeed, performing the ritual is outlawed, and will earn one nothing but a long stay in the local dungeon.  Many say that the Brotherhood still exists in more uncivilized parts of the world, operating freely in the Skyrim Commonwealth and along the Baandari coast. Whatever the case, citizens of the Potentate can rest easy, knowing they are safe from such savage practices as paid murder, and that any hint of the Dark Brotherhood\u2019s presence in the Potentate will be met with extreme prejudice.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that citizens can\u2019t hire Dark Brotherhood assassins anymore, but most of us know that it\u2019s not because they were wiped out. Helseth Hlaalu would never throw away an asset, and it\u2019s said that the Brotherhood has been an asset to him since before the First Great War. Opponents of the Potentate often turn up dead, and it\u2019s rumored that the captain of Helseth\u2019s personal guard, a Dark Elf called Dram, is the secret leader of the New Brotherhood. These rumors are spread freely, ignored by the Potentate, and it even seems that Helseth may enjoy the speculation. It\u2019s not as if anyone can do anything about it, unless they\u2019d like a poisoned arrow buried in their chest. I\u2019ve heard talk of \u201cTrue Brothers of Darkness\u201d in other territories, who follow the old ways of the Brotherhood and offer assassinations to anyone who\u2019s got the coin.

The Nords hated and feared them, and it was not uncommon for Jarls of less fortified holds to hire a group of Companions or sellswords to kill any that strayed too close to a town or settlement. This all changed when the Silver Plague decimated almost all trade in Skyrim, and its natives were forced to turn to less conventional partnerships, including their massive neighbors. The relationship at first was tenuous, with the Nords using primitive techniques such as painting patterns on items to communicate what they wished to trade, and miscommunications resulting in the death of one or both parties not being uncommon. However, it was soon found that many Giants already spoke limited Tamrielic, and some Tribes learned enough to effectively, if primitively, communicate with Nordic traders. This trade relationship was solidified when Gor Lonely-Hearth of Winterhold published A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Giantish, a book which attempted to translate the Giant\u2019s guttural tongue, allowing the language barrier to be broken from both sides. By the time the plague receded and the Commonwealth was instated, the Giants held such a large role in Skyrim\u2019s economy that they were granted citizenship, and the Tribes of each hold are given representation at Hold Moots. Indeed, if you travel to any of the hold capitals, you can see the massive doors that have been installed into the Longhouses of each Jarl to allow the local Giant representative to enter. Throughout the region one can also find Giant traders, called Mammoth Merchants by the locals, outside many cities and settlements. They\u2019ve driven away most competition by intimidation alone, although some groups of Orc traders maintain small footholds, namely in Hjaalmarch. </p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Green%20Prophecy%20in%20Bloodtoil/","title":"The Green Prophecy in Bloodtoil","text":"<p>The mystery of Elden Root has baffled Potentate scholarship. The city was burned down by the Thalmor during the Second Great War in failed efforts to crush rebellion. Today, however, it has regrown to its previous size in but a fraction of the time that its progenitor did. The native explanation, as we will describe below, is not taken very seriously by academics but remains a fixture of Bloodtoil spirituality, a \u201cfounding myth\u201d if you will. </p> <p>It is said that the Thalmor sought to sever the Bosmer\u2019s connection to the Green once and for all by destroying the great tree cities: Elden Root, Brakenleaf, Falinesti, and most crucially Silvenar. While they failed with Falinesti, the other settlements left ashen scars across the sacred forests. But worse was the spiritual scar left by the death of the Silvenar, voice of the Bosmer people. The Green Lady, enraged, called out to the Green-that-is-Z\u2019en, Spirit of Repayment in Kind. She became monstrous and feral, and so did her Bosmer followers. A Wild Hunt like the world had never seen ravaged the Thalmor governorships, literally devouring them, before the Lady herself disappeared into her home of Deepwoods. When a new Silvenar manifested, he was ungrateful for the sacrifices the Green Lady and her faithful had made, instead leading a group of Bosmer north to the city of Kvatch.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a High Prophet of the Green began to speak on the Lady\u2019s behalf, teaching that it was the corruption and decadence of modern civilization which had weakened the Bosmer and the other peoples of Valenwood. In this doctrine, only the Green Pact could ensure the security of the tribes and restore the lost glories of the ancients. And the Prophet was, allegedly, proven right: using the seeds of the old Elden Grove they were able to create a new one. They fertilized the land with the blood of the faithful, who sacrificed themselves to become one with the Green much in the same way Y\u2019ffre and the other Earth Bones had supposedly done in the Dawn Age. </p> <p>The veracity of such claims is almost impossible to determine. The Green Lady has been missing for a very long time, and scholars are kept from examining the new trees in fear they will somehow \u201ctaint\u201d the \u201cmarrow\u201d of the Green. The leading theory proposed by Aphia Megulus of the University of Bravil holds that the legend hints to the truth that the modern tree-cities are kept strong and healthy by some barbaric blood magic rituals.</p> <p>The difficulty in studying such myths lies in the decentralized nature of the Green Prophecy. The religion was founded by a figure known only as the Precursor, a wandering Bosmer prophet who attracted a large following in the late Third Era and early Fourth Era by claiming Y\u2019ffre would soon return to offer great gifts to the tribes of Valenwood. When the Aldmeri Dominion outlawed this movement it only grew in popularity. The High Prophet in the time of the Bloodtoil Uprising, an Imga called the Successor, began teaching that the Green had many faces: Y\u2019ffre to the Bosmer, Mauloch and Z\u2019en to the Orcs, Ius and Muluk to the Gobllins, Khenarthi to the Khajiit, and on and on it goes. This new pan-racial version of the faith allowed a true coalition of tribes to establish dominance over the region, but it also demanded variation. Thus, almost anyone can call themselves a Green Prophet, and the religion has no fixed doctrines (as words can never truly describe the Spirit of the Now), creating a faith that is highly prone to sectarianism. To be respected as a Prophet, however, usually involves years of preaching, teaching, and meditation, and the High Prophet is always elected by the oldest and most respected Green Prophets in the Chorus.</p> <p>Elden Root remains a popular spot for pilgrims from across Tamriel, despite the dangers of Bloodtoil \"society.\" Spriggans watch with fixed gazes as Potentate Bosmer come to pray at the Elden Tree, and sympathetic natives do their best to rush the foreigners along before they inevitably do something to offend the most zealous of the clergy. Some Prophets, hoping to scare off clueless foreigners, engage in exaggerated displays of mysticism to get \"in contact with the Now.\" Animalistic grunting, loud chanting, consuming large doses of moon sugar, intense mock combat and the like. These fake demonstrations do not fool the savvy Nibenean who can recognize shock tactics from the genuine article, but it is enough to keep to keep the average tourist from lingering too long.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>I normally don't go in for all that mysticism, but I was curious so I went ahead and asked a Green Prophet proselytizing in Haven for a summary about their religion. The answer was enough to make me wonder if the Geographical Society is being honest for once:</p> <p>\u201cSome think we are stardust trapped in flesh and bone. Some think we are the children of a Fox or a Dragon, though they cannot decide which. Some think we live in a Gray Maybe. They are wrong. We live in the Green. We live in the Spirit of the Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes the Green is the trees of the grove, the flowers in the field, the dirt under our toes. We name this Y\u2019ffre.

The south, they said, was too dangerous, the east unknown, but to the north, they could secure a route to the plains and beyond - bandits and Forsworn would melt away before the Legion.</p> <p>So they marched north, to reach the town of Half-Moon on the shores of Ilinalta, where they built a fort of rough timber, then north again, through the western foothills of the Brittleshins to the town of Granite Hill on the plains of Whiterun. Another fort was built and a garrison left behind, and again the legion marched north, to the town of Rorikstead. Yet another garrison was established, and the march began again, in a constant running battle with Forsworn raiders from the west. At the river Hjaal, the Legion turned and held, claiming the old fort of Robber's Gorge as they sent runners north to the town of Dragon Bridge and the city of Morthal asking for aid. And aid came, the remaining Imperial troops marching south from Solitude.</p> <p>Today, the route the Falkreath Legion followed is known as the Legion Road, with fortresses established along its length, ruled by the descendants of the legion, granted lordships by the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar and Karth. The road secures trade north and south, giving the coastal kingdom access to the bountiful harvests of the city of Rorikstead and the mines and forests of Falkreath.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Millitias%20of%20the%20Snow-Throat%20Commonwealth/","title":"The Millitias of the Snow Throat Commonwealth","text":"<p>The army and navy of the Commonwealth, much like the government, appear a mess to outsiders: nonstandardized, self-organized, and unruly. In some regards, this is true, in others, the citizen-militias form a perfectly effective fighting force.</p> <p>The militias are successors to the fighting forces of Skyrim that came before, the wandering brotherhoods of history, and the Imperial Legions. Organized into groups ranging in size from 10 to 100 soldiers, these groups are theoretically capable of coming together to work as a single, unified force. In practice, these bands are largely self-contained, self-equipped, and self-organized: officers may be elected or commissioned by moots, recruitment is nonstandardized, and equipment is varied. Attempts by national moots to organize the system have been of limited effectiveness.</p> <p>The most common arms of a militiaman are a sword or axe, a shield or buckler, a dagger, and a crossbow and bolts, both normal and magical. Many will also carry longbows, greatswords or greataxes, and javelins or spears.</p> <p>For armor, most will wear a gambeson and chain, armor in the style of the old Dawnguard, or Nordic housecarl-style steel, balancing cost and weight with effectiveness and mobility. Troops of Orcish descent or commissioned by Orcish moots may be equipped with heavier armor.</p> <p>The Commonwealth boasts few battlemages. Instead, there is a profusion of hedge wizards among the militias: lesser in talent and cability, but many in number. In addition, the widespread usage of magical and alchemical crossbow bolts means that even the average soldier will typically have some amount of destructive capability at their disposal, for better or worse.</p> <p>Most notably, the militias of the Commonwealth contain Giants, a force not seen in the militaries of any other nation. These massive soldiers are fearsome sights: some have chosen to deck themselves in steel and leather, wielding swords and hammers as large as a man, others carry ballistae meant for ships as easily as their comrades carry their own crossbows.</p> <p>In total, the militias of the Commonwealth are poorly suited for massed battlea, but perfectly suited for operating without supply lines, in skirmishes, ambushes, or guerilla warfare, and in holding chokepoints and serving as defense forces for their homeland.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Raiders%20of%20Orsinium/","title":"The Raiders of Orsinium","text":"<p>Travelers and merchants making their way along the coasts may come across Orcish traders peddling wares on the backs of domesticated yaks, adorned with banners bearing a Daedric symbol. This is the symbol of the ungoverned city of Orsinium, and by extension their god Malacath. It is advised to avoid these individuals, as both the Potentate and the East Empire Company have labeled them as criminals, and anyone who trades with them in territories belonging to either will be charged with the handling of illicit materials.  Since the end of the Silver Plague, the rogue City of Orsinium (the \u201cGreat Free City of Orsinium\u201d to its residents) has been the subject of the outlandish rumor that they routinely visit the myriad realms of Oblivion, bartering with Daedra for goods not found anywhere in Tamriel. Indeed, many of their traveling merchants do carry exquisite food and drink, rare alchemical ingredients, and weapons and armor of a seemingly otherworldly quality, and can be found on nearly any coast in Tamriel despite having no ships to speak of.  However, they are in reality dangerous marauders and bandits, their wares stolen from neighboring provinces; their food is pilfered from the houses of nobles of Wrothgar and Karth, their ingredients raided from witches covens in the Druadach Kingdom, and their armaments forged of stolen ebony from mines in the Commonwealth, shaped by Orcish blacksmiths into strange designs. Some scholars theorize that there are in fact many small, scattered bands of raiders, all operating independently in different areas while using the same banner to give the illusion of being part of a single united entity. This creates a mutually beneficial arrangement in which Orsinium seems to exert an enormous reach across Tamriel, making them appear larger and wealthier, and the traders appear to have the backing of the city\u2019s artificially inflated resources, which protects them from other marauders. Orsinium is in fact a small, disorganized populace, maintaining their stated independence almost entirely through intimidation. Although they claim sovereignty from any larger government, the city is kingless, and does little to negotiate or trade with any legitimate powers. They instead pillage and plunder for supplies, and are ruled by a mad council of \u201cBeseechers\u201d who claim to commune directly with Malacath within his realm of Oblivion, asking the Prince for his opinion on matters of state. Their primary military force is a single rogue dragon, whom they employ as defender of their territory.  The city is not officially recognized as an independent province by the Potentate or the neighboring Old Kingdom of Hammerfell, but they maintain an alliance with the Kingdom of Wrothgar and Karth, who through generosity or fear extend aid in times of need, though they gain little from this arrangement.  The savvy traveler should avoid any association with denizens, legitimate or not, of this rogue city, and report their presence in Potentate territories to the Guard.</p> <p>I was not born in Orsinium, but I\u2019ve been able to visit a few times. As Orc-ken, I am welcome, but outsiders are generally shunned. Besides the keeping of Malacathi traditions, the main reason for this is the secret workings of their Oblivion Whaleships. They are unlike anything seen in all of Tamriel; giant whalebone frames wrapped in moth silk, reinforced with orichalc and waving enormous sails bearing Malacath\u2019s sigil.  With these they travel to the Ashpit, Malacath\u2019s domain and a gateway to all realms. They bring back many strange and exotic wares, and use the same ships to travel trade routes along the coast, traveling and docking underwater to avoid being seen. They can be found selling nearly anywhere, but they have a particularly profitable arrangement with the Sanguine cultists of Port Katariah, who they supply with sacred beer and wine from the Prince\u2019s own realm. You can sometimes come across a spare bottle for sale, but it\u2019ll cost you a fortune, and you\u2019ll wake up days later with more regrets than just the coin you spent.  But the greatest use of the Whaleships is to carry the Beseechers, the mightiest warriors in all Orsinium, who by ritual combat with Daedric beasts earn the right to commune with Malacath himself, who now rules his people by his own word. This is why they remain unassailable, and why Wrothgar and Karth wisely entered an agreement for access to Orsinium\u2019s might in times of war in exchange for their sovereignty.  It is a harsh and beautiful place, and I hope to see it again.</p> <p>-Yzmul Gra-Maluk</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Remnant%20of%20Old%20Thras/","title":"The Remnant of Old Thras","text":"<p>Before the Sload migration to Tamriel, little had been seen of them since the Third Era, but when the Silver Plague began to sweep across Tamriel they were immediately suspected. Several kingdoms scrambled to muster their weakened forces for an expedition to Thras, but Wrothgaria and Karth were the first to successfully pull together the necessary resources. They enlisted the help of the College of Winterhold, and in 4E 219, the expedition fleet launched towards the Coral Isle. </p> <p>The college\u2019s assistance was necessary due to Thras\u2019 habitual changing of its position and shape. Locating the island proved difficult, but it was eventually detected far northwest of the Iliac Bay, in the icy northern reaches of the Sea of Ghosts, near Atmora. This was a strange discovery, as Sload were thought to do poorly in colder climates, and the scryers at the college had to reaffirm their findings several times before Queen Elisif approved the voyage. </p> <p>The expedition did not return for several months, and left four of their ships in the frozen waters when they did. Their findings were nearly too incredible to be believed: Thras had risen from the sea, the chain of islands becoming a single large continent that had seemingly anchored itself in place. The first thing the awestruck sailors had seen was an enormous spire, stretching into the sky as far as the eye could see. This had been sighted nearly three days before they made land, and only upon exploring the island did they realize that it was a monolithic mass of the same coral that made up the land itself, attached to the ground at the base. This was the so-called Pillar of Thras, which the Sload had traditionally used to carry out sacrificial murder by way of pushing the unfortunate victims from the top. It had been described in the All-Flags Navy\u2019s records from their assault on the island, but had not been noted as being nearly as large as it stands now, and had indeed collapsed during the battle. It is now estimated to extend some number of miles into the sky, though the top has never been seen, even during later expeditions carried out on dragonmount. Some have theorized that it now extends underwater as well, and this is what hinders the island from its former migratory behavior.</p> <p>The island at first seemed abandoned, but as the explorers drew closer to the Pillar, they began to encounter elderly Sload scattered about, their soft bodies rendered immobile on the hard, frozen coral. Official expedition records claim that these remnants were not considered a threat to the Wrothgarian travelers, yet later voyages carried out by the Potentate found piles of burned Sload corpses scattered about the isle. The expedition\u2019s members have never confessed to harming any of Thras\u2019 inhabitants, so one can only speculate. </p> <p>What is known not to be their doing is the array of Sload corpses that lay scattered around the base of the Pillar. These were initially difficult to identify as such, as most are little more than mounds of viscera. The source of these became readily apparent, however, as it was observed that every few hours a Sload would seemingly fall from the sky, splattering unceremoniously onto the ground. The first Wrothgarian expedition did not uncover the cause of the \u201cRaining Slugs\u201d (as the initial explorers called them), but later investigations by scholars from other provinces, as well as firsthand accounts from some Thrassian refugees, have confirmed strange behavior that is exhibited by the remnants of Thras.</p> <p>When the island erupted from the sea, many Sload were killed, and most of the survivors fled. The few who remained developed a strange fixation on the Pillar of Thras, and some began to believe that it now extended all the way to Aetherius, acting as an earthly tether to the source of all magic. The faithful gathered around the base of the Pillar, performing experiments and rituals in an attempt to harness this connection. Then one day, they began to climb. </p> <p>It seems the Thrassian remnant thinks that if one reaches the top of the Pillar, they can ascend to Aetherius, and thus a higher state of being. And so they slowly climb, gripping the sharp coral with their flabby fingers, or using levitation spells to propel their large bodies upwards. Most will lose concentration, slip, or succumb to exhaustion, and fall down to be added to the putrid piles of slug matter that litter the land around the Pillar. It is unknown if any have completed the climb, although the ones waiting for their turn below claim to see evidence whenever one of their brothers or sisters has ascended. The Tamrielic Sload seem to look down on this practice, most of them calling the remnant zealots. Old Thras is now rarely visited, but the Pillar can be seen for miles, and the occasional sailor will talk of seeing a sudden, blinding flash of light from the sky surrounding it.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20Streets%20of%20White-Gold/","title":"The Streets of White Gold","text":"<p>The silence is deafening as you walk the streets of White-Gold.

More specifically, the ultimate origins of the cult trace back to a core of fourteen who either journeyed to or met at the Lonely Mountain on the plains of Whiterun, and were tutored in the Voice by at least one dragon.</p> <p>The first three of the fourteen are claimed to have been members of the Companions of Whiterun, who abandoned the mead-hall of Jorrvaskr in the early days of the plague to wander the plains. The second three were allegedly members of the Whiterun guard, witnesses to the Last Dragonborn's slaying of the dragon Mirmulnir. The third trio are claimed to have once been members of the Blades, who left Sky Haven Temple before it was beseiged by the Forsworn. The last three were members of Kyne's Wanderers, a brotherhood of wandering Kyne-worshipping herders. Of the final two, little is known - many claim that they were the Last Dragonborn and his housecarl Lydia, others claim that they were another Thane and Housecarl of Whiterun, and yet others claim that they were neither.

Some claim that the dragon they met there was Odahviing, patron of the New Tongues, others that it was Paarthurnax, patron of the Greybeards, who has not been seen in centuries, others still claim that there was an undead dragon, or a dragon scaled in gold. Some stories claim that the dragons had fought until only Odahviing remained, others that they cooperated, others that there was only one or the other, never more than one. The truth will likely never be known, as Odahviing has remained silent on the matter.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, the first of Dragon Monks, these neo-Tongues, set out from the Lonely Mountain, wandering warriors who brought peace to the land through their martial skill and the Voice.</p> <p>Today, the Lonely Mountain stands as a holy site for the New Tongues and the Kaal-Drem.

The first two routes - Solstheim and Saarthal - are the major routes, of which the last three are variations.</p> <p>Solstheim is the simplest route, one which initially travels the common sea-lanes between the Commonwealth and Resdayn. Ships will set out from Windhelm or the Port of New Winterhold, sail to Raven Rock in Solstheim, offload cargo, take on supplies, and then set out north. </p> <p>The Saarthal route is typically traveled by the more devout sailors. Setting out north, the first stop is at the Port of New Winterhold, where propitiations are made to the Knowledge Gods - Jhunal, Orkay, and Mora - before sailing west to the hermitages of the ancient city of Saarthal. There, under unseen eyes, the sailors will ask the favor of Magnar, beseeching the All-Seeing and Unseen to protect them on their journey north. Dazzle the eyes of enemies by day, cast shadows by night, allow them to slip through ice and snow unseen by sea giants to reach their destination unharmed. After such rituals are done, the crews will then set out for Atmora.</p> <p>Solitude is the route taken by the more crafty traders. After visiting Saarthal, the ships will then hug the coast, laying anchor in the Jarldom of Dawnstar to trade, then setting out to the capital of the Kingdom of Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth. There, in the harbor of Solitude, the ships will offload goods from the east, buy or barter for goods and supplies from the Kingdom, and then set out again, trading with coastal villages to the west before sailing northwest to the frozen north.</p> <p>Skaal is a variation on the Solstheim route, and arguably no different. This route takes care to visit the Skaal in the island\u2019s northwest, trading goods and occasionally people, as Nords seek to visit their distant kin and the Skaal themselves sometimes seek to explore the greater world. This route will then take the ships to the northeast, rather than north as the main Solstheim route will.</p> <p>Sload is the newest route pioneered by the expeditions. Similar to the Solitude route, ships will hug Tamriel\u2019s coast as they head west, then strike out northwest into the Sea of Ghosts. There, the crews will use the Pillar of Thras as a navigation point, taking advantage of its settled nature upon the open ocean. This route takes the expeditions far to the northwest, to the most sparsely explored reaches of land in Atmora.</p> <p>Snow-Throat\u2019s expeditions to Atmora have been of limited success. The land itself is so harsh as to be uninhabitable, frozen and beset by glaciers that creep from distant mountains to calve into the sea. What settlements exist are seasonal as of now, coming to life in the spring as ships arrive and freezing over in the fall as the inhabitants leave for the winter. They are nearly completely reliant upon Tamriel for supplies, save for fishing and hunting of horkers and whales. Yet the Commonwealth persists. Ships map more of the coast each year, sending expeditions with surveyors inland. More ruins of Atmora are excavated with each passing season, claimed from the ice and snow. Most recently, ships have brought with them supplies to build greenhouses and carve deep into the rock, giving hope that one day, citizens of Snow-Throat will live in Atmora year-round, beneath the midnight sun of summer and endless night of winter.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Sidebars/The%20worship%20of%20Arkay%20in%20the%20Potentate/","title":"The worship of Arkay in the Potentate","text":"<p>The Third of Heathfire, known also as Tales and Tallows in the Iliac Bay, is a day of remembrance and giving tribute to the dead over most of the civilized Tamriel. In some places it is a day of loud public festivals, or of warding off the spirits. In the cities of the Totambu, they pound the drums, explode the alchemical substances, and parade the colorful dragon-serpent made of silk and paper. In Colovia and most of the North-Western parts of the continent, the people are afraid to come out after dark, and cover the doors of their houses with the spirit wards.</p> <p>In the lands of Nibenay it is a day of quiet communion, memory and respect, and all branches of the extended families come together on that day. More traditional Nibenese and Nords also travel to the actual burial sites and tombs, while Dunmer prefer to hold services at their indoor family shrines. In some cases, as of those lost at sea, the services are held at the Capital Temple of Arkay instead.</p> <p>The priesthood of Arkay has always been the most pragmatic of the Temple orders - even their titles reflect that, consisting of Apprentices, Journeymen and Masters. While other orders argued theology, and philosophers and wizards tried to trace the relationships between the Divines and the planets, the servants of the Mortal God made sure that the soul of the dying arrived where it wanted to go, while the living remained assured that everything was as it should. The Nordic branches of the priesthood preserved and passed the techniques of embalming from the Dragon Cult times.</p> <p>Following the massive flood of Dunmer immigrants, the demand for the cremation, traditional ashpit burial and ghost binding far outstripped the ability of the adherents of the failing Tribunal Temple. Willing neither to have the unmourned spirits running amok, nor to deprive the Dunmer citizens of their right to their traditions, the Temple of Arkay in Cheydinhal picked up the study and implementation of the Dunmer practices.</p> <p>Out of this collaboration, as well as the drastic impact of the massive death toll of the War and Silver Plague, and the advancements of the scientific study of the soul, a new understanding of the Death have been born. The Cheydinhal Arkayn Temple holds the belief in multipartite soul, and so separates the soul energy that can be tapped into, the living mutable essence that goes on to Aetherus, and the shell of memories that constitutes the ancestor ghost.</p> <p>Binding of such memory-ghosts to the mortal remains, temporary or permanent, for the purposes of communion is one of the key services of the Arkayn priesthood, and had earned them the folk name of Bone-Charmers. The ensurance that the living essence would not be held on its way, or the energy would not be tapped into is another one.</p> <p>Together with the alliance of the Laborer Guilds, the Temple had worked for decades to define the limits between the acceptable use of sentient soul binding and un-allowable necromancy. As per the Elder Council edict from the 16th of Frostfall of 4E397, the only acceptable usage of the 'black soul' binding is for the temporary, structured pentinence in the form of the Bonewalker of the Arkayn Temple. Raised from the worst criminals, traitors, the ones cast out of their families, those undead workers do most of the manual jobs for the Temple, and can be loaned out. As such status is temporary, and doesn't include monetary compensation, it is not necromancy as defined within the Potentate.</p> <p>YgM: I may dislike religion and mysticism in general, but I can't forget how it was a priest of Arkay who allowed me to say the last goodbye to Grandmother. She died while I was at sea, you see. And they always don't feel like priests to me, more like surgeons or craftsmen. Much less inclined to proselytize at you, and always so tired, but ready with a supporting word.

These vessels can vary broadly in size, design, and purpose, but have two unifying facets: construction from whalebone &amp; moth silk and the general shape of a whale. </p> <p>The external skin of a whaleship is made of sheets of moth-silk, inked with runes and spell-circles to catch, store, and direct magica. Motivator-runes cover the fins and tail, allowing for the generation of a push/pull effect, while other patterns serve to strengthen the silk, immunize it and the interior from magical effects, attune it to the currents of the Mundus, and much more.</p> <p>The whalebones themselves form the interior skeleton of the ships. Engraved with channels and runes, bound with wires of orichalc and steel, the bones give both structure and purpose to the whaleship. For reasons unknown as yet, the whalebone itself appears to allow transit between planes - an oddity noted by many familiar with the Nordic myths.</p> <p>The earliest and indeed most archaic of whaleship designs resembles a whale internally as well as externally. In imitation of a living creature, skeins of silk and woven orichalcum form muscles and sinews, motivated to move through careful application of magica. Often cramped and inefficient compared to modern designs, few remain in usage by whaleship crews, more often ending up in collections across Orsinium or stored in the vaults of the Deep Orcs. </p> <p>The whaleships of the Beseechers and the ruling council take a modestly different form, but at a much larger scale. These whaleships are the largest to be found, comparable in size to the largest ocean going vessels of Tamriel. Large enough to house a crew of dozens for weeks or even months at a time, the ships of the Beseechers have upon their back an arena, in which the Beseechers themselves must undertake ritual combat against Daedra before each audience with Malacath. Internally, these vast creations utilize a system similar to the earliest whaleships - artificial muscles and sinews to shape and direct the whaleship and catch the all-important streams of magica beamed from Orsinium through the Ashpit.</p> <p>The most modern designs of the Deep Orcs have taken a different approach. Whilst silk and orichalc sinews may be found wrapped around the frames of bone, these whaleships utilize far more clockwork machinery, reverse-engineered gyros and bearings from Dwemer mechanisms and manually-driven controls reduce the amount of magica required to power the whaleship. Instead, that magica can be channeled to the motivator-runes, accelerating the whaleships to unheard of speeds. Most whaleships built in this style so far are relatively small raiders and traders, holding crews of a dozen or less.</p> <p>While the strength and prosperity of Orsinium is largely thanks to the whaleships and trade they bring, cracks have begun to emerge in Orcish society. Production of new whaleships and whaleship designs is the territory of the Deep Orcs, who have become increasingly insular and removed from wider Orcish society, some even going so far as to forswear the worship of Malacath. Many see this as worrisome - for what will happen if the Deep Orcs decide to retreat further from Orsinium, deeper into the depths of the Dragontails, or vanishing into the Ashpit itself in the bellies of whaleships and mountains stolen from the surface world?</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Weird%20Lore/A%20Boy%20and%20a%20Dragon%20-%20an%20Altmeri%20fairy-tale/","title":"A Boy and a Dragon   an Altmeri fairy tale","text":"<p>The story I am going to tell you is a lie.

Pay me to see the Moons? Sister, looking up is free. What!? How do you know that name? You with the Synod? I didn't do anything I swear, I- Okay, you got me. Yes, that's me. Yes, I did go to the Moons and I can take you there. But not a word to the Synod, okay? I'm not supposed to be... practicing anymore. Look, here's a list. Be back next full Moons with the ingredients and three hundred drakes and you'll get your trip okay? And not a word. To anyone! Ah, started to think you wouldn't come. You're in luck, cloudless night, that'll make things easier. You got the stuff? Heheh, I knew you were reliable, sister, last time I made this brew, some idiot brought me skooma instead of Moonsugar! Not even the Dunmeri stuff, that diluted Skyrim crap. Sorry Commonwealth. No offense, but at my age you get set in your ways. Here, take the nighstshade and put the leaves in that boiling water there. Then stirr. Clockwise one full turn, then one full turn counterclockwise, keep going like that until it's all blue. Meanwhile, I'll crush the Moonsugar and the Nirnroot together. A potion? Ya think? You outta work for the Watch with a brain like that. Course, it's a potion! People be swearing by Alteration or Destruction or Mysticism, or what have you. But Alchemy's the real deal. Magic's all around us, just waiting to be used by someone with more than two braincells to rub together. Poison? Heh, what isn't. Sure my gums aren't pretty to look at, but sister, that's a low price for the things I've seen, things I've done. Never could bring nothing back fo' sure, but never had to run away from a Daedroth neither, Heheheh. The nightshade's just there to... Lower your defenses, open you up a little for the rest. Moonsugar comes from beams of Moonlight, you know that? What knows the way down, knows the way up. Nirnroot gives you an anchor point, and reminds Them of Their family. Gimme your hand. There! Human blood. Oh stop whinging, you're a big gal. Look it's the same for me. Altmer blood. Twin bloods for twin Moons. Duality, light and Dark, Anu-Sithis, they still teach that, right? There it's ready. Just wait for it to cool down, go sit in the Moonlight, and gulp it down in one go. I prepared a spot for you in the backyard.</p> <p>The people of the Moons brook neither god, nor king, nor leader of any kind, for that is Solar thinking and therefore finds no purchase in the Land-in-Between. When decisions are to be made, all those of proper age speak with an equal voice. Their communities are small, as the largest caterpillars can only house up to nine families within its bowels, and disputes are settled quickly, by resettlement if necessary.</p> <p>The people of the Moons are of Nibenean stock, but generations of living in tunnels, breathing thin air and running in a land where the grip of the Nirnbones is weak has given them pale skin, long limbs and swollen torsos. They herd their caterpillar-houses to the bottom of the deepest craters where the air is densest (though still thinner than even on the slopes of Mt. Hrothgar) and therefore breathable without the living suit of caterpillar-larvae required for the Plains-under-the-Stars.</p> <p>There, they mine the silver ore that they fashion most of their every day tools from and trade, alongside mothsilk, with passing Jumper Khajiit or Lygian Slipsmugglers for Jodefeathers or crabwood. When time allows, the bravest dig past the Dibellite layer to mine the Ebony underneath, but this runs the risk of waking a Worm before the season, and it is not unfrequent for entire mining teams to disappear. But the godsblood so acquired is necessary to forge weapons strong enough to repel ghost-snatching raids from Revenant, Meridian Solar Legions and their Void-borne Auxiliaries and, above all, the harassment of the Great Worm and its four Unstar Champions.</p> <p>But there is one enemy that cannot be fought. The Dark Wall. During the time of Contraction, the Wall advances, slowly but surely covering all the Land-in-Between forcing the Moonfolk to flee within an ever shrinking area. It is a Time of gloom and conflict as caterpillar-clans fight over ever-smaller territories. The People wear clothes dyed in black and white and those who are born during that time are said to be melancholic or anger prone. When nearly all the Land-in-Between are covered by the Darkness, the Moonfolk unfurl their caterpillars' wings and take flight. During those flights mothsilk can be spun and marriages are celebrated as Moths mate together. During that act, some of the families of each caterpillar-clan leave it to join the other. This is known as Flightseason and when Flightseason happens together on both Moons, Great celebrations are held as some clans depart one Moon for the other, according to the whims of dancing Moths.</p> <p>Then comes the Time of Expansion, when the Dark Wall recedes. The Moths land and their great wings are furled back. The caterpillar-clans spread over the Land-in-Between once more. It is a time of joy and partnership as the Moonfolk enjoy an ever-expanding bounty. The people wearclothes dyed in all the colors of the rainbow and the children born during that time are said to be light of spirit and quick to forgive. Once the Dark Wall has vanished entirely, it is Crawlseason, a somber time as dead caterpillars are buried in sacred spots, to wait for their rebirth, and the grown larvae have their insides excavated in preparation for the next Contraction.</p> <p>Of particular note are the ziggurats. Grand black pyramids built by forgotten architects. Their only inhabitants are hermits, left there during Expansion with supplies to last until Contraction. They spend most of their time pondering the strange winged Worms painted on the walls of the ziggurats and watching distant Nirn, for old legends and superstions claim that the ancestors of the Moonfolk once came from there, riding one such winged Worm and that another may yet come again. Their real purpose, however, is to tend to the Nirnsalt-gathering nets, a precious substance used to both flavor food and predict the coming of the next Worm season.</p> <p>Food is scarce on the Moons, consisting of a diet of caterpillar-grown algae and occasionnel Worm-meat, but water even more so. The Moonfolk gather what water they can from condensation within mining galleries, and recycle all that they use as much as possible. The caterpillar drinks first, followed by the algae, and then pregnant women and little children. The remaining water is divided in equal rations that are distributed among the clan. Thirst is a terrible thing in the Land-In-Between, and to take more than one's ration is the worst of crimes. For this reason births are carefully controlled using potent prophylactic magics.</p> <p>When a child comes of age, they must travel to the very edge of the Dark Wall, as close as they dare (some, too daring for their own good, never Come back), and gaze on its surface until they can discern moving shapes on it. These are then interpreted by the oldest of the clan as to predict the youth's future.</p> <p>The Little Moon is not as spacious as the Big Moon, but its Dibellite layer heals much faster, making those clans who dig it that much richer in silver. However, on rare occasions, it will be traversed by deep tremors. When this happens, those clans who find themselves on it dig large holes for their caterpillars to fit in and seal themselves in, waiting for the crisis to end. Everytime this happens, some arrogant youth will insist on staying outside to prove their strength. They are almost never seen again, but those who are come back wounded, speaking of a Land dyed blood-red by terrible storms within which monsters hide.</p> <p>The dead are a common sight in the Land-in-Between. Most are foreign spirits, of all kind of shapes and colors who wander the Plains-under-the-Stars by foot in large groups. They do not fear the Dark Wall but they never speak to the Moonfolk, preferring to huddle together as they silently gaze at the sky. The Moonfolk's own dead are much more amiable, as they simply continue their tasks and duties as they did before, with no need for rest or food. It is very common for them and their relative to forget that they are dead in the first place. But eventually all dead find themselves at the same place. Unlike the Dark Wall, the Light Wall is stationary and made of single white rock. It encircles its respective Moon in the place where Nirn is so low on the horizon that it has almost vanished. It is mottled with an infinite number of black and white gates, each of which will only open for only one mortal. How one knows which gate is theirs is a mystery. They simply do. Even the living may recognize their gate should they come across it, prompting all but the bravest to flee in terror. Past the gates, pitch-black tunnels stretch for an unknowable length until they reach a distant light. No living has ever been able to cross a Gate, even opened, but many have scaled the Light Wall. None have succeeded in describing what they saw from there. They speak of an hemisphere that is not one, a great expanse that curves on itself while at the same time stretching infinitely in a straight line, of impossible shapes that hurt to look at and of colors for which there are no names. None has ever scaled the Light Wall twice.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Weird%20Lore/Alasilbis%20Orsinium.%20Fragment/","title":"Alasilbis Orsinium.

Often, many have fallen into the trap of oversimplification and racial essentialization: that among the barbaric and magic-fearing Nords and Orsimer usage of magic is taboo at best, leaving magery to the ever-distrusted Dunmer - and of course, what could the dull, primitive Giants know of the sorcerous arts?</p> <p>Such opinions are, of course, ignorant: of the cleverness and cohesion of Snow-Throat's citizens and of their skills at magic.</p> <p>Now, it is true that the College of Old Winterhold - the primary institution of academia in both Snow-Throat and Greater Wrothgaria - is almost ridiculously conservative, clinging to outdated definitions of the Schools of Magic, quaintly teaching courses in Restoration (their most popular course of study), Enchanting, Alteration, Destruction, Illusion, Conjuration, and Alchemy, whilst treating modern understandings of magic as dangerous and ill-guided, to be carefully and painstakingly examined before utilization. Nonetheless, in spite of - or indeed, because of - this excessive caution, the College and it's alumni have become broadly accepted across Snow-Throat, as academics, consultants of Moots, teachers and engineers. Only rarely do College-trained mages find employment in the militias, leaving that role to common, largely self-trained mages and spellswords.</p> <p>Such mages - the Clever Men, witches, hags, shamans, spellswords, nightblades, witchblades, witch hunters, daedra hunters and more - are profuse in and out of the ranks of the militias, as drifters, hermits, mystics and sellswords, inheritors of the grand traditions of wanderers and recluses that has seen a revival since the Plague Years. While nowhere near as common as the mage-knights of the Iliac or as powerful as the battlemages of our grand nation, these amateurs make up for their lack of might with cleverness, cunning and often shocking brutality, honed by years of skirmishes and battles against sea-giants and Falmer.</p> <p>The arts of Alchemy are the most commonly practiced traditional form of magery by the citizens of the Commonwealth, in conjunction with and often the same as their brewing of alcohols and curing of meats and cheeses. Nirnroot plantations in the Rift have a near-monopoly on Tamrielic nirnroot production, and strange, powerful and exotic ingredients found nowhere else in Tamriel are commonplace, used singly or mixed with strange concoctions. This alchemical cottage industry has in turn allowed the nation's militias to be dangerously well-armed, as the creation of frost, fire, and shock tipped crossbow bolts is perhaps the simplest usage of their skills.</p> <p>Finally - and most embarassingly for the mages of the Potentate - one must consider the practice of Tonal Magic. While elsewhere Tonal manipulation is the realm of theory and conjecture, for the denizens of Snow-Throat it is, quite literally, child's play.  Schooling in the formation and use of Shouts begins almost as soon as children can speak, learning Dovahzul alongside their native tongue. Imitation of their elders comes with internalization as children grow and learn to understand the world around them, simple concepts of ice and fire and wind and more becoming deeply understood and integrated. Few outside of the orders of Dragon Monks ever master even a single full Shout, for doing so takes years of study, but simple, single word Shouts are commonplace, used in everyday life. Fires are lit with a single word, food warmed or cooled, beasts pacified, charges of herders tracked with a single whisper. Men and women imbue their arms with strength and speed to wield scythes at harvest, challenging even the most clever contraptions of smiths, and children race each other with great Shouts of \"Wuld!\" to propel themselves recklessly forwards. Such usage makes the people seem truly elemental: it is as if the cold does not truly touch them, striding through swirling snow almost unaffected, standing fast before a charging bull or mammoth, swift and sure as the wind.</p> <p>A note, scrawled at the bottom of the page: We get it, Maurius.

Some attribute the biggest influence to the Silver Plague, some - to the series of rebellions and civil conflicts that shook both the Cyrodic Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. Some look even further in the past and speak about the end of the Septim Dynasty.</p> <p>The most mystically inclined scholars of all traditions, however, tend to remind of the return of the dragons, and above all - of their leader, the Black Dragon Alduin. They associate him with the Alduin-World-Eater of Nord legends, and look for parallels in other mythologies: Sep, the Serpent, Alkhan.</p> <p>The key event, in their opinion, was the defeat of the World-Eater by the equally mystical figure known as Dragonborn. This defeat - here the versions differ - should have either prevented or heralded the coming of the new age, a new 'kalpa' in their mystic parlance.</p> <p>The versions on the origin and nature of the Dragonborn are diverse as well.

Scholarly consensus is that the letter is a work of fiction meant to perpetuate anti-Potentate sentiment, which was all but confirmed a little over a year after its release when Renulus was found to be working extensively with a group of Dunmer insurgents and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. He was found hung in his cell less than a year into his sentence, with many suspecting foul play on behalf of the insurgent group in order to protect their identities. The letter is still occasionally held up by conspiracy theorists as supposed evidence that the Dark Brotherhood still operates in Tamriel. Potentate Helseth has encouraged the spread of its contents, stating that it provides valuable insight into how rebels use propaganda to undermine faith in the law. The letter is reproduced here in its entirety. </p> <p>Brother Sicarius, This letter is for your eyes alone. I hope you have maintained order after the unfortunate death of Matron Herna. We recently lost our own Matron Galis, and I have had to take up leadership of the Sentinel Chapter myself. The guild has been in disarray since the raid on the Dawnstar Sanctuary, especially those within Potentate territories, who have been hunted relentlessly. A week before the time of this writing, the majority of guild leaders received a missive via courier bearing the seal of the Potentate. It seems that Helseth knows the identities of nearly every one of us, with most presumably only being protected by the limited reach of his jurisdiction. However even this is not a reliable measure of safety, as he amply demonstrated by causing the death of Matron Galis shortly after she received the letter, through methods that will become clear to you as you read on. I assume that Matron Herna was in possession of the letter addressed to your chapter, and was unable to relay its contents to you before she was killed on her way back to your Sanctuary. I have therefore copied the contents into this letter so that you, as temporary master of the Daggerfall chapter, can make a decision for your Brothers.</p> <pre><code>                                    ***\n</code></pre> <p>To the leaders of all Dark Brotherhood Sanctuaries throughout Tamriel and its territories:  The Potentate has monitored your continued operation after the war, and it has been tolerated to a point. However, your organization has become outdated; even those of you that fall outside of our immediate reach will eventually be uprooted and scattered. I therefore offer you a new code to operate under, in service to and within the legal protection of the Potentate. I am aware that this is not a prospect that you will be eager to take up, and so I have made arrangements to assist in persuading you to consider my proposition.  The body of your so-called Unholy Matron has been taken from the sanctuary in Dawnstar, and the one bearing the title of \u201cListener\u201d has been disposed of. If you wish to continue to receive contracts, you will do so exclusively from me. In exchange, you may continue to venerate the Night Mother, and be allowed to access and maintain her body. A hidden base of operations has been constructed for you, including a temple to Sithis, whom you may still worship with your service. You will be afforded protection and secrecy, and be well compensated for your efforts.  This is a most generous offer for a guild of murderous outlaws.  Should you accept, you will return a list of all current members of your chapter who agree to these terms. Any who do not must be turned in to the Guard or executed. Any chapter that rejects these terms as a whole is of the understanding that they will be treated with utmost prejudice, and that their continued operation will be considered a slight against the Potentate and be returned as such, regardless of territorial jurisdiction.  To that end, this letter is laced with a poisonous powder, which entered your lungs the moment you opened it, and will take effect within minutes. The courier that delivered it has been instructed to wait outside, and will gladly provide the antidote in exchange for its return. I eagerly await your response. -Esteemed Potentate Helseth Hlaalu</p> <pre><code>                                     ***\n</code></pre> <p>Matron Galis refused to give up the letter, and instead ordered us to execute the courier. She succumbed to the poison before the deed was even finished.  We now face a difficult choice: to serve this tyrant, or to cease to operate altogether. However, some have embraced another path: a return to the days of old, when the Brotherhood answered to no central authority. We True Brothers will continue to serve Sithis, with or without the Unholy Matron. By the time you receive this our chapter will have already relocated, and you will receive no further contact. However, I hope you will refuse the Potentate\u2019s blasphemous offer, and follow us in our earnest service to the Dread Lord. Remember the Music of Life. -Genitris Nox, Night Mother of

During the First and Second Era, the Saraathu Tong, a consortium of wizards operating under the protection of House Hlaalu, established itself within the unclaimed Oblivion Plane known as \"Fargrave\" or \"The Celestial Palanquin\". From there they have been able to establish and maintain a series of trade partnerships within other realms while reversing part of their profits to the Hlaalu Council. One such partner (also located within Fragrave) was the House Hexos, a noble family of Cyrodiil who vanished from Nirn in the thirteenth century of the First Era, evidently having moved their base of operation to Fargrave despite the vast wealth they controlled in Tamriel. Unfortunately, all mentions of Fargrave, House Hexos or the Saraathu Tong disappear from records during the Second Era Interregnum.</p> <p>Analysis of recovered House Hlaalu ledgers and historical estimation of the wealth of House Hexos at the time of their departure for Oblivion has yielded a first estimate of how profitable inter-planar trade could be for the Potentate (see Appendices C through E for details).</p> <p>Operational Options: The Commission has identified several potential stable means of access to Oblivion that could (pending deeper investigation) be used to establish such trade relations.</p> <ul> <li>Fargrave: The Commission suggests that a research team of Daedrologists be tasked with re-opening communication with the Celestial Palanquin.</li> <li>Addendum: Despite investigation into the accessible archives of House Hlaalu and the former domains of House Hexos, the precise Supermundial coordinates of Fargrave remain unknown. Divination efforts are still underway. (See Appendix F)</li> <li>The Ashpit: The Commission suggests that, through proper sacrifices and rituals, contact be made with the Daedroth Prince Malacath in order to access his plane as the Orcs do.</li> <li>Addendum: The Daedroth Prince has refused His High Excellency the Potentate's offers. Attempts have been made to reach the Ashpit anyway, but the Pariah Land remains as nigh-impossible to access as ever for our magicians. (See Appendix G)</li> <li>The Weir Gate: The Commission suggests that the ancient access to the Imperial Battlespire be re-activated and that the possibility of establishing a new outpost on the other side be examined.</li> <li>Addendum: The Weir Gate has remained unresponsive to all known opening rituals. It is speculated that the \"Battlespire Realm\" has completely collapsed following the destruction of its proto-Tower anchor. (See Appendix H)</li> <li>Marukh's Abyss: The Abyss is an underground rift in the Mundus, discovered in the seventh century of the First Era and located near the modern-day town of Rivercrest, Bruma County. It is said to be a pathway to many realms \"of Oblivion and beyond\". The Commission suggests that the Penitus Oculatus be tasked with assessing wether the Snow-Throat Commonwealth makes any use of the Abyss and the possibility of seizing the area for our purposes.</li> <li>Addendum: Agent \"Hilltop\" of the Penitus Oculatus reports that a local knightly order, \"the Order of the Deep\", has established itself in Rivercrest with the explicit purpose of preventing anyone and anything from traversing the Abyss, one way or the other. As the Order of the Deep appears to be operating in association with both County Bruma and the Church of the Eight (more precisely the Archdiocese of the Divine), Penitus Oculatus analysts advise against military action. (See Appendix I)</li> <li>Jacinth and Rising Sun: This potion is said to have the ability to transport the drinker to the Fields of Regret, the realm of the Daedroth Prince Clavicus Vile. Unfortunately the recipe, said to be an \"alchemical riddle\", has been lost. The Commission suggests that a research team of Alchemists be tasked with the re-creation of this potion.</li> <li>Addendum: Mistress Ko-Randa reports no progress yet. (See Appendix J)</li> <li>The Screaming Gate: In 4E 1, an Oblivion Gate appeared on a small islet of the Niben Bay. Unlike the Oht-shaped Gates associated with the Oblivion Crisis, this gate was shaped like a screaming thee-faced head (understood to be a depiction of the Daedroth Prince Sheogorath) and, more importantly, no horde of monsters poured through it. Conjuration experts from Chorrol established that the Gate allowed free passage to and from Sheogorath's Plane of Oblivion, the Shivering Isles, but only to Nirn-born entities. Since Daedra could not use the Gate to invade, since the islet presented no tactical or mineral importance, and since he was faced with the more pressing events of the turn of the Era, the Count Bravil elected to leave the Gate alone. In the centuries since, a small hamlet of artists and disturbed individuals, named \"Inspiration\", established itself at the foot of the Gate. The Commission suggests that the islet be seized and scouting parties sent through the Gate to establish contact.</li> <li>Addendum: Scouting parties report that the Gate leads to an area known as \"the Fringe\", within which seats the town of Passwall. Passwall's mortal residents informed the scouts that the Fringe serves as an antechamber to the greater Isles and are separated from them by the \"Gates of Madness\". An advance camp has been set up in the Fringe and a commando sent towards the Gates of Madness. The commando has failed to report back so far.

Also contributing to this were certain groups of mer, who still held bitter grudges over the suspicious and sometimes hostile treatment of elves by many of Skyrim\u2019s population before, during and after the then-recent Second Great War. </p> <p>While mundane usage of Words of Power quickly became so commonplace that most hostility among regular citizens dissolved relatively quickly, relations among the smaller groups who learned more advanced applications of the Thu\u2019um under the tutelage of Dragons were much more strained.

A group of priests atop the Umbral Tower, in the city of Dusk, performed a powerful ritual involving the use of an Elder Scroll they looted from the White-Gold Tower in the First Great War, and a portion of Dragon blood from Skyrim, among other implements. The aim of this ritual was to erase the very spirit of Talos from the face of history. Moons orbiting Nirn aligned for eight hours: the longest eclipse on record. Dusk was almost entirely destroyed by a burst of arcane energy. Various other calamities are said to have occurred on this momentous day, though few can agree which are true.

Let us be grateful that we now live in an age of tolerance, that we can see both heads of the Dragon-Saint as equally deserving of veneration. The modern Potentate would never stoop to such violent lows as our predecessors, but instead welcome open debate and disagreement. Within reason, of course.</p> <p>Marcus Permean, Theurgist, Arcane University</p> <p>The Thalmor had hoped to excise Talos from the Divine, but they failed. Instead, a wondrous miracle occurred: the Lorkhanic moons and the Magnan sun aligned and a message was issued from Heaven that all the Divine are now of Unitary Spirit, and that Tiber, Celestial Emperor, was a representative to Man. One of many! The modern Archiocese is founded upon this Eternal Truth. Glory to Akatosh! Glory to Lorkhan! (but I repeat myself), glory to Magnus! (but I repeat myself), glory to Tiber! (but I repeat myself).</p> <p>Elthyrra Mooring, Diviner, Alcaire</p> <p>It is true: Talos is no more. The Thalmor sacrificed thousands of their own people to shoot him down from the Firmament with an Aetherial Bow, Elder Scroll recording the event as permanent and backdated. Sky-Mother Kynareth mourned his passing, and a great blizzard covered the entirety of Tiber\u2019s homeland in the middle of summer. A dreadful time for all of us. Now Tibedetha is a day of sorrow rather than celebration here.</p> <p>Torvald of Bruma, priest of Ysmir, Bruma</p> <p>Talos may be gone, but the Thalmor failed. It will take more than a cabal of desperate elves to remove the spirit of humanity. And make no mistake, desperate is what they were - but they killed the wrong face. All they did was make sure that the true Dragonborn God would ascend - Ysmir, who walked the world and rose to his true divinity in a day of darkness and roaring, snow-throated winter.</p> <p>Ingtar, Dragon Monk, Bleak Falls Monastery</p> <p>The Thalmor misunderstood, and paid for their misunderstanding. Talos is but a face of Ysmir, and Ysmir is eternal. To slay the man, one must also slay the dragon - for the man and dragon are the same, are they not? Perhaps one day the elves will understand the truth of many faces, for all faces are one.</p> <p>Chaplain Desnia Pinethorn, Primate of Auri-El, Kvatch</p> <p>What a tragedy. The Thalmor attempted to wage war on the Heavens. All they \u201cproved\u201d is that we mortals desperately need Divine guidance to maintain order and stability. Auri-El the King, Magnus the Architect, Merid-Nunda the Keeper. They want only what is best for us, to follow the Divine Mandate and lead a life of proper discipline. That is why the Archdiocese is founded upon false and heretical thought, and should come back into the true fold. \u201cOneness\u201d deludes mortals into believing that they, too, could one day become as Gods. Just as the Thalmor believed. The ending will be just as destructive.</p> <p>Salethiarani, Ahemmusa Wise Woman, Rotheron</p> <p>Thalmor? They had nothing to do with it. The alignment of the Moons and the shaking of Red Mountain was a sign from Azura: that all Resdayn must unite or be cast aside. Sul-Gandra of the Urshilaku, under the advice of his wise women, formed an alliance with the other tribes and was made Gah-Khan. When the Argonians invaded again from the south, just as the farseers had heard from the ancestors, the Gah-Khan made alliance with the Hortator of the House Dunmer. The reptiles took much of the south, but they were stopped at Narsis. One day Lady Azura will send us another champion, like the Dragonborn or the Nerevarine, to free the rest of our ancestral homelands. And that includes the lands still being plundered by the Empire. Or is it the Potentate? The name matters not, the spirit is the same.</p> <p>Thaggia, Welkynar, King\u2019s Haven</p> <p>Ha, that was somethin\u2019 alright. Damned Thalmor thought they could kill a god. Instead they blew up a whole damned city! Dusk\u2019s still a sad vestige of its former self. It kick-started the revolution, though, so it worked out for us in the end. Spread themselves too thin in the war, and we kicked their pompous asses right out of the Eton Nir! By the Eleven Forces, I get excited just thinking about it! Let me tell you some of my grandpap\u2019s old war stories. Next round of golden ale on me.</p> <p>Halnach the Wolf-Voice, Vateshran, Markarth</p> <p>The Day of Darkness is remembered with holy feasts here in the Reach. The World of Spirit and the World of Flesh became as one on that day, and the Druadach trembled from the union. The Tricky Hunter changed the skin of some of our bravest warriors, and they slew the Nords and the Bretons and the Imperials in their forts. The Forsworn had been fighting for our freedom for many an age, it is true, but that day was when the war of liberation began in earnest. </p> <p>Vasha, Mother Navigator, Gottlesfont</p> <p>Of course that was an awful day, the story was passed down to me from my foremothers. The Dark Moon turning day into night for so long? It caused quite the panic in Dunei, but that is another story. A dust storm kicked up from Sentinel to Gilane, and for my ancestors it was a sign from Tava herself that a great change was coming. They began to walk new roads farther and farther from the Alik\u2019r, and made contact with the cat-mothers from the south. When the Plague hit, our trade kept all of Tamriel united, and the mothers prospered from it. And when the mothers prosper, everyone prospers. Now Tava and Khenarthi are as one, and the Mother Navigators can make a special trip, just for you. Same low price.</p> <p>Kallo Tallhorn, Green Prophet, Bloodtoil Valley</p> <p>Foolishness. That is what it was. Do not believe things you cannot see with your own eyes, hear with your own ears, or smell with your own snout. This Talos\u2026 can you see him or taste him? No? Then he was never real in the first place. Tiber was just a man. If he was a good man, he would have become One with the Green. But he didn\u2019t, because the greed of gold corrupted his soul and led him astray of the true path. What a shame, what a shame.</p> <p>Isezara al-Verkarth, Onsite war-priestess, Hegathe</p> <p>What more proof do you people need of the wickedness of the Elves? We who keep the memory of Old Yokuda alive needed no reminder, but perhaps this sin which outdoes even the cruelty of the Left-Handed Ones will finally reveal them to you for what they are: the devious, greedy and ill-willed children of Sep. Yes, Sep! Although the Second Serpent came to them in the guise of his father to fool them into worshipping him, we know who the Serpent That Moves Like So in the Heavens truly is. And now, look what his patronage lead them to do! They tried to murder the very spirits of Humankind! Not Talos, that feeble Nordic memory of a deluded White King, but Fierce Hoonding, Noblest Onsi and Undomitable Leki, and to do this they blackened the Moons! The very eyes of Tava, ward-mother of all Men, ripped from her. Sacrilege four times multiplied by itself! Let us give thanks to Tall Papa for smiting the Elves as he did their master in the beginning, and let us carry out his will and wipe out their scourge from this World!</p> <p>Reads-the-Stars, Nisswo, Rockgrove</p> <p>Ah that was quite something that the Thalmor did, wasn't it? Not the results they were hoping for, heh? They called on Sithis as the Great Destroyer and complain when he gives them his blessing? Yes, Blessing. look to the High Elves as they were: rigid, unified, turned to the past, in love with Stasis. Stasis which is worse than death, for death is part of Life, Stasis which is living as if you're not. And now look at the Altmer as they are: here merchants, here tyrants, here artists, everywhere free. Reborn and multidinous! This is the Truth of Sithis the Great Changer, that there isn't one Truth but many. We learned that lesson long ago, and now so have they. Is it co\u00efncidence that the High Elves' Fall happened in Dusk*? Perhaps even Sithis has a sense of humor.*</p> <p>Laizuma, Centaur Trailmaker, Wilderness</p> <p>Ah the Elves. Of all the mortals the most prone to swinging from an extreme to the other. Duality has always been their curse, perhaps it will always be so. Who today remembers how they slew Gheatus and the Ilyadi before adopting the Elder way that they had taught them? Do you remember the Madness in the East? When the very Ash cried out under the tyranny of a masked demon? Are you surprised then, than an equal and opposite Folly would Rise in the West? You should not be. They have meddled with forces beyond them, as they so often do, and a terrible price was paid for it. One that is not understood yet by the people of Dawn's Beauty. That is all I will say on the matter.</p> <p>Henri Derre, Priest of the Eight, Northpoint</p> <p>I will not bore you with the obvious symbolism of the eclipse lasting eight hours for the Eight Divines, as the skeptics would deny that as a coincidence anyway. Instead I will emphasize that the Talos Mistake was, indeed, a mistake. A break with sacred tradition which had horrendous consequences for us all. For millennia, from the rise of Empress Alessia to the reign of Tiber Septim himself, the Imperial Church recognized only Eight Divines. That is not to say other spirits of great power such as Magnus or Shezarr never existed, but instead that the Eight Aedra which orbit Nirn, who sacrificed themselves to make the world, who represent the Eight Virtues, who are found in almost every culture in Tamriel, are indeed the supreme Gods of the Mundus and the Gods most worthy of centralized worship. Tiber Septim\u2019s haphazard addition to the pantheon was a lapse in judgment, one of the most grievous errors of the otherwise glorious Septim Empire. He was a great man, a Saint and an Apostle, but he was not a god. The Thalmor did not \u201csucceed\u201d because there was no god to kill in the first place.</p> <p>Tumindil, Primate of Julianos, Skingrad</p> <p>Do they still teach such nonsense in Nibenay? The so-called \u201cTibedetha Incident\u201d was nothing more than a set of coincidences and cheap magic tricks. An alignment of the planets that long is indeed rare, but if you come visit the Orrery we just had installed here in Skingrad, I can show you how it might occur as a result of focused chronomancy and increased varliant activity. The Thalmor had done a similar trick before in the Void Nights. The reports of earthquakes and blizzards and sandstorms that occurred around that date indeed happened, but are falsely remembered as all occurring all on the same day due to the spiritual significance retroactively ascribed to that time period. After all, war and plague would go on to topple both of the largest political powers in Tamriel. In hindsight that day seems a good spot for mystics to claim as \u201cthe beginning of the end.\u201d Serious historical analysis, on the other hand, will demonstrate that the fall of the Empire and the Dominion were purely mundane in causation.</p> <p>The arcane overload brought about from the Thalmor tampering with an Elder Scroll undeniably had very real consequences for the people of Dusk, and that was a tragedy, but the larger metaphysical consequences are purely imagined by the Temple Zero ideologues gaining uncomfortable levels of influence within the Archdiocese. I do hope the Archbishop of the One will finally repudiate such superstition.</p> <p>Morlia of Skywatch, Sapiarch, Shimmerene</p> <p>Failed? You think they failed? Look at the Seat of Sundered Kings. The Wheel within the Wheel lies dormant, save for a handful of maggot-priests writhing in the Empire\u2019s corpse and preaching a long-dead doctrine invented by an ape. Talos is dead, no one worships him anymore. Not the way they used to. Dragon cultists call him \u201cmany-faced\u201d now because even they cannot deny that the oversoul of that Mannish upstart has been shattered. The Aldmeri Dominion is gone, and good riddance, but a new phoenix shall rise from its ashes. We are not done with you, child of the Niben. Once the Blessed Isles are united once more, we will carry the Divine Revolution to every shore, breaking your kings and jarls and hortators and potentates upon the stone of Anu\u2019s Glory. Then we shall know peace everlasting. Then we shall know the New Era. Then you shall know the truth of Tiber Septim's failure.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Weird%20Lore/The%20Ever-Higher%20Heartland%20Elves/","title":"The Ever Higher Heartland Elves","text":"<p>ECMB-MRA: mnemonic daedron-capacitance memospore classification x3E4E00SAbs</p> <p>cogitocode: Eight gods, eight provinces, eight as an infinity that stands upright.

Despite launching on a clear night, the destruction of the vessel was not visible from below, and indeed, the ISHA appeared to have vanished in its entirety moments before we received a transmission. Only shortly after did large fragments of metal and stone begin to plummet from the sky, much of which appeared to be debris unrelated to the ISHA itself. Among the crew of fifteen survived only three, who were able to communicate via dreamsleeve transmission to explain their situation and their findings, following their surprise crash.</p> <p>The ISHA had seemingly collided with a large land-mass, held in suspension approximately 50,000km above ground. The surviving crew had ejected from the point of impact and landed upon one of several other island-like landmasses in the surrounding areas. This floating mass is, or was, reported to be one of a total of nine. Eight islands - now reduced to seven, with the ISHA having crashed into and destroyed the stability of the eighth - were observed in arrangement around a ninth island in the center, with each of the islands surrounding it slowly spinning in an orbit around this central isle.</p> <p>The most notable feature of these islands is not that they were floating, but that they were riddled with what appeared to well attended and undamaged Ayleid architecture. The immediate area upon which the Mananauts had landed showed numerous signs of active habitation, lights lit within buildings were observed, and several in-tact landmarks and statues could be seen. The most obvious of these was located directly at the heart of the central isle, a large and pointed Tower which extended equally above and below the island's surface, similar in appearance to a spike that had been driven through the land. Periodically, waves of various shimmering colors could be seen travelling the Tower's length, although the Mananauts were unable to precisely measure the period of time between these waves.</p> <p>At 3:38 AM, a number of individuals, either with wings or winged apparatuses, were seen flying to and from the falling island after the ISHA's impact. Others came to investigate the landing points of the surviving Mananauts' aeropods. Contact with the Mananauts became scarce at 3:45 AM, until later at 4:16 AM, when another transmission was received from the Captain of the ISHA, Garland Rulician.</p> <p>The following is a transcript of this dreamsleeve transmission.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Damn it all. Can you hear me down there? This will be Report #3. Maybe our last, given the circumstances. </p> <p>Officer Burdsson is fluent in Ayleidoon, and according to her, these people are speaking it. Or a variant of it, at least. What we've been able to understand would indicate that they view the ISHA incident as an attack of some sort, on account of the level of damage it dealt to that island. Unless they take a trip down below and investigate the fallen remnants of the thing, I'm not sure they'll realize that it isn't a weapon. They know that we're here, too, and they don't seem happy about it. Burdsson is sure she heard the word \"kill\" more than once. </p> <p>I'm still not quite sure how we hit anything in the first place. It's like this place just came out of nowhere. Too large to have been sitting in the night sky all this time, but I can't imagine it moving very quickly either, so . . . gods, where did it come from? And if it's always been here, how has it been kept hidden?  Nine hells, are there others out there like this? </p> <p>Hold on. I'm seeing something . . . some sort of . . . swarm of machines, fluttering out of the tower. The one in the center of the middle isle. They're like . . . fabricants, maybe, only . . . stoney. Some sort of blue light trapped inside. They're all flying out to the remnants of that island the ISHA hit. And . . . uh oh. Those ones look like they're coming towards us. </p> <p>What? Where? Oh, dammit, fine. I've got to put this on hold. </p> <p>Come on, keep left; heads down, careful. Careful! That patrol is about to--</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>The transmission ended at this moment. As of yet, we've not received further communication from the Mananauts.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>-----</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>The significance of thriving Ayleid survivors, the strange developments in technology they display, the hidden nature of these folk and their lands, and the similarities in structure between these islands and the ancient arrangements of the Imperial City, are facts that hang heavily upon the heads of this council. The moth-minds do not have sufficient information on the matter to determine a course of action as of yet, which I believe is a misfortune we should make efforts to correct.</p> <p>Although our resources are strained between the efforts to rebuild after Dagon's invasion and the efforts required to keep the peace without an Emperor, I would nonetheless maintain that we must make it a priority to discover what the Ayleid are up to in the skies, and to discern their intentions for the world below. Otherwise, we are leaving a blind-spot in the security of Tamriel; a blind-spot that appears to be angry with us.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Weird%20Lore/The%20First%20Cant%20of%20Ysmir/","title":"The First Cant of Ysmir","text":"<p>Ysmir strode into the plains and spoke to the wind.</p> <p>\"I have seen my face and slain myself.

A Medley","text":"<p>The Green Pact is often misunderstood by outsiders. Even today, textbooks still use the framing of the \u201cDivine Commandments\u201d handed down from On High, perhaps a lens inherited from the old Alessian Order. This misses that for the Bosmer Y\u2019ffre is the Singer, a Spirit of the Now. Even \u201cPact\u201d might be a poor translation, one which feeds into imagery of cold, static laws. This is even more inaccurate as the Bosmer spread across Tamriel, finding themselves engaged with the push-and-pull of various cultures across Dawn\u2019s Beauty. Perhaps a better analogy to explain the Bosmeri perspective on the Green is that of a traveling bard who sings a familiar tune, but improvises to meet the needs and dispositions of the current audience. May the passages which follow, taken from across the continent, serve to better elucidate the truth of diversity in the Green.</p> <p>The Green Pact and the Ooze - A Traditional Tale</p> <p>Before, was the Ooze. The world was chaotic void and the people without shape, an endless cacophony of meaningless noise. Eagles and Dragons and Scarabs fought each other until they became each other, Elves becoming Cats becoming Men becoming Elves again.</p> <p>So Y\u2019ffre called a Chorus, and gave every thing a Name and a place in the Song of the Green. The rustling of the Trees, the rushing of the Rivers, the warbling of the Birds; all have a special role in the Song according to their Name and purpose in the Natural Order. It is our goal, every one of us, to Sing in tune with the Green, with respect to its Order, lest we be cast out again into the Ooze. </p> <p>To Invoke the Name of God - The Jephrine Paladin's Canticle</p> <p>The Singer did not give us the Pact to be a Tyrant over us; Jephre gave us the Pact so we may know the limits and test them. Is it not obvious? Nature abhors stagnation, but She rewards growth and ingenuity. We are asked to take part in Creation, in the Naming, in the Song of the Green, so others may marvel at what our ancestors have brought forth. </p> <p>Learn the Names; the true Names of the Trees, the Rivers, the Birds, the Stars, even the Gods themselves. Call the Names in Song, and they must come to your aid. Call them to shape cities, to heal the sick, to beautify the garden, to illuminate the ignorant, to reward the faithful. The Song is our ally, and no more faithful an ally will you find.</p> <p>Graag-Unslaad - From An Evergreen Bosmer Saga</p> <p>Alas, we were cast out of our homes! Scattered by the tyrants of the Old Dominion! And so we wandered. North we walked, as far as we could get from the cursed scars of our old woods. We at last found ourselves in a bitter place of cold winds, yet the Trees were Ever Green! Most assuredly, it was a blessing from the Singer. We grew new homes in this holy place, but some of the Northern Men grew wroth. There may have been blood, if not for the Voice.</p> <p>One Sang and another Shouted, until the two were as One Voice. Mara moved Man's heart with compassion; was not Song also sacred to Dibella? Does not Kyne also have a fondness for Trees? Did not even Mighty Ysmir speak drem ov to the Spirits of Nature?

Priority: now. If we still have wax, then use the old seal. The one with the tusk.</p> <p>I put away the fanciful story of House Sul and listened. After eight days, an unfamiliar sound now intruded on my cubicle. The days were as much of a fiction as Charting Zero Deaths out here, but my memories and the tally of the sleep-cycles stubbornly agreed. It took me a moment to understand what attracted my attention - it wasn't something new, it was something missing. The almost-unheard wailing cry of the soul gems had gone silent, and now there was a faint whisper from outside. As I tried getting up, I realized that my body felt weightless, as if I were floating underwater. Windows were a liability to the contraption, so I would have to go out and check where I was. I floated downwards and started unlocking the latches that held the hatch closed. While I did that, I checked the concentric arrays of soul gems that first alerted me. They were dim, and some of them had even cracked. They looked just like I felt - burned out by the takeoff. It was a complicated setup in which I cast and held featherfall on the whole contraption while first the powerful explosion of the alchemical compound, then the enchantment powered by the soul gems propelled us upwards. The effort of the spell had left me drained of Magicka - and I still didn't feel it starting to come back.</p> <p>But that was the least of my worries. The gems running out so soon meant that all my calculations were faulty. They were supposed to work for much longer and bring me in sight of Masser. The view out of the hatch was not what I had expected. I had long dreamed of seeing the Nirn from the outside, wondering how it would look from such a distance - as a giant ball, similar to the moons, or perhaps a huge, flat expanse terminating in jagged waterfalls. I saw neither.  Instead, I only saw the pinpricks of distant stars. Taking my planned precaution, I used the clever alchemical device that I purchased off the Snow-Throat merchant to light my water pipe - not even a simple Sparks spell for me yet - and dove outside.</p> <p>The view of what I had still been thinking of as 'upwards' was even more strange than I expected. No sight of Masser or, indeed, any of the moons or planets, but instead there was a line of floating broken rock and stone, with strange and weirdly shaped debris seen here and there. A glint of dwarven metal, a giant feathered wing looking as if it were wholly constructed from glass. Some of the debris looked organic - a desiccated moth, for all the world looking like one I would brush out of the cobwebs in an archive room, but miles long, if my eyes didn't deceive me. A whale skeleton of even more massive proportions. Here and there on the rocks I noticed clumps of vegetation, and occasionally there were regular openings, reminding me of windows and doors. I quickly dismissed the notion. In one place there was even an old Ra-gadan sailboat, looking as if it had been cast ashore by the sea.</p> <p>When I noticed the sailboat, my perspective shifted suddenly. The rocks ahead were rapids, and an unseen river was carrying me and my temporary home towards them with increasing velocity. Panicking, I did the only thing I could think of - I drained one of the Magicka potions and cast Featherfall on myself. Immediately, I slowed down, while my dwarven-plated bell shot forward, swimming - no, falling towards the rocks.</p> <p>The slow descent gave me enough time to reconsider the ten years of choices that led to this point. Making secret copies of the newly discovered Remanian archives. Painstakingly translating them from that curious archaic language where sexual innuendos, magical instructions and theological revelations used exactly the same mode of language. Sleepless nights spent worrying whether the universe had played an enormous practical joke on both us - the Archivists - and the Elder Council. Whether there ever was an Aetherius Exploration program. Or whether the Dibellite Interpretation was more correct than the Magnusian one, and the whole corpus of those texts was a bedroom guidebook, an instruction on poses and devices Reman used to satisfy his presumably numerous concubines.</p> <p>Then the time spent gathering the supplies, many of them restricted, and some of them prohibited. A decommissioned diving bell from the underwater construction of the new southern port. Enough Dwemer metal to fully cover it. A store of powerful Magicka potions. All innocent enough. Soul gems of at least great power, not all of them acquired legally. And finally, the secret ingredient of this experiment, the smallest surviving part of which rode in my water-pipe. Skooma, which I've reconstructed from the manuals and Khajiti texts to serve as a sanity anchor, in a paradoxical way.</p> <p>How I struggled to gather all the legally available stores of moon sugar and distill them according to my own secret recipe. How humiliatingly I had to reach an agreement with the local gangs of the Cheydinhal slums I lived and worked in - the anonymity and silence I desired so much turning against me. How I tried to persuade them I didn't want to trade in their territory, and how I had to surrender half of what I produced 'for protection', slowing down the progress of my preparation for years.</p> <p>Now that store of precious, sanity-preserving skooma had crashed through the layers of ancient debris with a weirdly quiet noise, and all that was left for me was the contents of my water-pipe. I had to ration it, pulling in the sweet smoke once in ten breaths, once in twenty, trying to get used to the feel of the leaden band across my chest. Senseless whispering voices slithered at the corners of my sight, dark shadows rung in my ears, the whole world gained a curious dream-like quality, and I was suddenly viscerally afraid to wake up. As if I, Zirik Not far ahead was a series of the rectangular openings I have spied from above. From so near, they indeed looked like doors and windows protected by huge stone slabs, ornately carved.

The noises I made echoed strangely, and I did not notice anything around me until I heard a sharp commanding cry right behind me. , was only a dream-shadow of a giant slow and reptilian mind, an ephemeral presence quickly forgotten. A fresh drag on the pipe pushed the feeling back somewhat, but always not enough.</p> <p>Three heights from the deck of the sailing boat - as I somehow managed to aim my fall on it absent-mindedly - the spell fizzled out, and I ended up in an undignified sprawl. I took a store of my situation - no food, no water, no weapons, no tools, bar the the water-pipe, one vial full of Magica potion, one empty, and tough sailor clothes of raw moth-silk. The sailboat looked like an antique, and were I not so pressed for time, I would love to explore it further to determine its age properly. But as it were, I was only interested in retrieving my supplies. Climbing down from it, I stumbled across the uneven rock in the direction of the crash. The landscape looked bigger from that perspective, the distances seemed to increase as if I walked across one of the bigger islands. I felt as if I were walking for hours, although I had no way to measure the time, and the shadows never shifted. The taste of skooma grew fainter, and I was afraid what would happen when it ran out.</p> <p>Not far ahead was a series of the rectangular openings I have spied from above.

A dozen pairs of eyes looked at me, but the people they belonged to were neither men nor mer. The eyes themselves looked insectoid, convex surfaces of fractured mirrors, the bodies had two arms and two legs each, but the joints, the proportions, the movements looked insect-like as well. Chitin-covered fingers gripped me, and immobilized, despite all my struggles. I felt something forcing my jaws open, and tried to bite it, to spit it out, until I felt the familiar sanity-saving taste of skooma. One of the - Attackers? Saviors? - seemed to take off the insect-helmet, and a different face looked back at me. Slightly too elongated for men, with sharpish ears and golden skin, cat-slit eyes and too much hair, but fully within the variation of that mongrel breed that now called themselves Nibenese. I wouldn't have given him a second glance if I'd seen him on the streets of Cheydinhal.

So it is that I shall open this public address, made in the hopes of assuaging these misplaced concerns and clarifying our purpose, with a vital commandment: </p> <p>Mistake not the Marukhati for our antecedents. Our faith is born of the Fourth Era and its tumult, our mission likewise.</p> <p>\"As One in Heaven, as One on Nirn,\" this creed speaks to our truest intentions. If it is said that the Divines serve as examples for we mortals, then a Divine of inextricable singularity should serve as an example for the uniting of all mortals under its blessed concord.</p> <p>Cast your mind to the great tragedies of our era: the interregnum, the first Great War, the White-Gold Concordant and the civil war in Skyrim, the second Great War and the fall of the Empire, what cause lay at the center of all this conflict? What could motivate such senseless violence? Schism; differences of faith, of ideology, and the dredging up of ancient feuds best left beyond the pale of the tolerant age of the Septims.</p> <p>I speak, of course, of man against elf and elf against man. History is fraught with this primordial contest between those who have forgotten where we come from, the Divines to which we all owe our existence, and the ties which bind us together as misplaced siblings, kin under the One.</p> <p>Our Cyrodiil is just now beginning to mend this woeful rift, as she has in ages past. Think now of the tragedies of the First Era and the crimes of the Marukhati. Though we may credit the Prophet Marukh for laying forth the laws and customs of our society, and, indeed, for first conceptualizing the mono-theological model on which our own is founded, it is clear to any moral persons of our era that the \"Oneness\" preached by Marukh was at once paradoxically divisive. Simply recite his Exclusionary Mandates to any citizen of our modern world and watch as they react with the utmost shock and disgust at the bigotries contained within; the most critical being the allegation that the mere existence of the elven people is a \"taint\" on our world.  Their cultures, their magicks, and even their gods were regarded as blasphemous poisons which corrupt the lives of men, a sentiment so ludicrous that it is unthinkable in our age of peaceful cohabitation with our elven brothers. Yet this is what the Marukhati believed, and with this self-righteous code of racial superiority, they committed ghastly pogroms and massacres throughout our homeland.</p> <p>I have held closely to the position that such disharmonious thinking has no place in our common era, and yet still, some may recognize this rhetoric, some of you may have even lived through it. An inversion of this exact sentiment, in which man is cast as the folly of creation, is known to be the hard-line stance of the Alinori traditionalists; the very same who, most recently, lent their ideology to the dreaded Aldmeri Dominion and its ruling body, the Thalmor. The Thalmor considered any people but their own to be \"impure\" and committed atrocities with this perceived justification, even upon their alleged \"allies\" in the Dominion. In this regard, it is impossible not to recognize the commonality of these two historical evils, the ugliness that festers in one, man or elf, who strays from the wisdom of the Divine and sees only enemies in all unlike himself.</p> <p>Reflect on the arrogance of these two movements, their profane attempts to change the gods themselves to fit neatly into their distorted visions of the world, and the catastrophes they thoughtlessly invited upon us. Yet consider that all their fruitless efforts to divide us have proven is that very Oneness they refused to see, for how can they divide two gods, Auriel and Akatosh, if they are-- as any scholar knows-- One and the same? How can they think to kill a god, Talos, when he is One with all gods? </p> <p>The vastness of their rituals' consequences are proof of the interrelation of what we once preached as individual divinities. When the heavenly bodies aligned over Cyrodiil City, it was the One itself speaking to us, showing us in a way that we might understand the truth: that there are no differences above us and should be none before us on Nirn. </p> <p>This is our doctrine. We worship the All-in-One, the eternal good, the force behind all virtue, behind all gods worshiped by honest folk, whatever they may be. The One is Akatosh, is Auriel, is Mara, is Shor, is Y'ffre, is Azura, is Khenarthi, is Ruptga, is Xarxes, is Malacath, and one thousand and one equal repetitions. Our great work is the joining of all noble faiths in Tamriel beneath the unity of the One, who all noble people already worship under its many guises. We are sworn enemies to discord, to hatred, war, and strife among tolerant peoples for they are all the same under the singular eye of the One. Our dream is a Tamriel united under the guiding principles of the One, under whom all are equal, and all good is rewarded, and all evil is punished. </p> <p>It is my earnest hope that this address has enlightened you to the singular truth. We are not so foolish to believe it shall be easy to convince others; many agents of disunity have broken from the body which once governed the Eight faiths and now governs the One, but we know the truth. This is the only path forward for us. This is the path to a peace that shall rule as long as time itself.</p> <p>One Faith, One God, One Tamriel.</p>"},{"location":"PGE%20Texts/Weird%20Lore/Understanding%20the%20Fire-Scholar/","title":"Understanding the Fire Scholar","text":"<p>\u201cBoethiah is the sacred flame, and Mehrunes Dagon is the fire of destruction.

Our sacred task is to study magicka, the gift of Azura, and to control magic, the gift of Boethiah. Some call us tyrants. Others call us heroes. We are neither. We exist to fulfill our duty to the Ancestors, to Resdayn, and to the Hortator, in that order.</p> <p>Why were we formed?</p> <p>In the late years of the Septim Tyranny, magic was regulated by a foreign Mages Guild. They cared only for profit, not duty or piety. They did nothing to stop a host of foul necromancers and other dark sorcerers who ran wild across Tamriel, kidnapping youths, defiling tombs, consorting with Bad Daedra, and worse. Only after this madness came home to Cyrodiil during the Oblivion Crisis and the return of Mannimarco did the Imperials finally see the error of their ways. But it was too little, too late. Ald\u2019Ruhn was destroyed by the perfidious wizards of the Mythic Dawn.</p> <p>One survivor of that horror, who had known too well the wickedness of unchecked magisters, vowed to never allow it to happen again. When Resdayn was once more struck by the excesses of unregulated magic in 4E 48, the Grand Council finally heeded her call to form a new order. The Order of the Molag\u2019kena.</p> <p>What is our task?</p> <p>We study magic so that we might control it. No avenue of study is forbidden to us. Our founder, the honorable Nartise Arobar, believed that it was necessary to understand evil if one is to triumph over it. We learn the ways of elemental war magicks, conjuration, necromancy, even the manipulations of souls. We do this so we may recognize the signs. Anyone who uses these magicks for personal gain has no place in our order. We also host great libraries, and perform extensive academic research.</p> <p>By the grace of the Temple and the decree of the Hortator, we may arrest anyone in Resdayn practicing magic without licensure from a proper authority. In recognition of ancient rights, the Velothi Tribes are exempt from these laws. By right of treaty, most outlanders are also exempt. For information on licensure, see the nearest oathmer in your legal jurisdiction.\u00a0</p> <p>We wield war magicks to fight necromancers, followers of the Bad Daedra, and generally any enemy of Resdayn. Perhaps this risks contamination; but fire must be fought with fire.</p> <p>How do I join?</p> <p>Perhaps you feel the call. So long as you are sincere and dedicated, you may join our ranks regardless of clan or tribe. Seek out a scout who may direct you to one of our outposts or strongholds on the frontier. Or travel to our headquarters at Silgrad Tower. You may prove yourself a worthy initiate to a recruiter. After extensive training, you will become a full-fledged member of the order only after passing the Rite of Flames and taking the vows. The greatest among our order will, after decades of distinguished service, become Exalted Elders: the leaders of the Molag\u2019kena who formulate policy and directly advise the Hortator.</p> <p>What are the vows?</p> <p>The Vow of Piety:</p> <p>I shall serve the Ancestors in this life and the next. I shall do everything in my power to protect the holy places of the Ancestors from the defilement of necromancers and sorcerers. I shall never submit to the Bad Daedra.</p> <p>The Vow of Duty:</p> <p>I shall protect the liberty of Resdayn and its people from rogue wizards until my final breath. I shall accumulate knowledge of magic, and share it responsibly. I shall not abuse magic for self-gain. </p> <p>The Vow of Gravity:</p> <p>I shall serve the Grand Council and the Hortator, advising them in the proper use of magic.

And that of its true heirs, we who were blessed with dual skins by the Hunt-Father! Do not call this place \"Wrothgar and Karth\", for its true name is far more ancient and far more powerful than the little lies of cowards who quiver behind stone walls! This land is the Rim of the Sky! Where the very Earth rises up to meet the Heavens! Where winds flow like rivers, and where water takes on the strength of rock, in memory of the Formless Times!</p> <p>The Times of Liberty! When all were free to run without the shackles of form and name and face and death! When Mer, Man and Beast were words without meaning for all were one and one was all! Before the Liars came, as Tree and Hawk, and Song, and Law, and Scythe, and Scroll, and Stars, and the Sundering of birth! And before they tricked the Dragon into eating his tails and flying one way, circle-wise, cycle-wise, and told to the everything: \"You are Plant and you are Beast, and forever shall you remain apart. You are Man and you are Mer, and forever shall you remain apart. You are Life and you are death, and forever shall you remain apart.

And this new lie, which they called \"civilization\" was so great and so pervasive that the Land itself would have believed it, if it weren't for Hircine Hunt-Father, who never believes liars, and slays them wherever he finds them. And in nights like this... Yes, in nights like this, when the Moons are full and the winds shriek with the Mad One's voice, the Land remembers. And we, we who have stayed true throughout the centuries of the Time-Lie, are free to shed the shackle of form, and run and hunt as we really are!

I see it in the quivering of your quill, I hear it in the quickening of your breath, I smell it in the soiling of your breeches.

Have you ever felt more alive? Have you ever loved yourself more than in this moment of pure terror? This is the truth of the Hunt! This is the grim delight of Struggle!</p> <p>But you're not the only one we will share this gift with tonight. Oh no, for tonight we run north, away from our lairs in the lands of craven, half-witted Brown-Green Reachfolk, towards the snowy walls of mis-named Solitude, where we shall howl and howl again, while its White-Blue people fall to their knees in delicious terror, until she howls with us. She! Hircine's Witch-Wife! The Wolf-Queen who bore him a son and mortal heir. The Burned Emperor, not of the weak, frozen blood of Atmora, but of the joined blood of the Dragon and the Hound!

Obviously, we can always say that the original writers in a lot of the cases knew jack shit, and wrote whatever, and we should change it to be realistic.</p> <p>And that is most likely even true, but I find such approach boring, and loosing the whole attraction of having a speculative world in the first place. Instead, I think a better approach would be to find a somewhat realistic-looking v interpretation that matches the original lore most.</p> <p>Like, one of the most iconic features early TES games had was a division of armor into light, medium and heavy. And taken at face value, it's the utmost DnDish nonsense, as it takes armors from different time periods and just dumps them together, giving them arbitrary attributes and values. Historically, full chain armors of the 12th century were not lighter than full plate armors of 15th century, they were just less advanced and less protective.</p> <p>But that's only if we compare TES stuff with the Medieval European stuff. There's another perspective that makes much more sense. After the invention of firearms, the destructive potential of weapons started matching and overtaking the protectiveness of armor. Arguably, on Tamriel weapons always had that potential due to magic and enchantments. So 'heavy armor' shouldn't be comparable to the ~30 kg knightly harnesses. Instead, they should be compared to the later siege armors. Even the lorebook describing fighting in heavy orcish armor doesn't describe a usual armored fighting experience. Instead, it speaks of purposefully slow movements and self-supporting joints. That's not even siege armor, that's some early underwater suit stuff.</p> <p>So, the first point is that Tamriel's 'heavy armors' are indeed heavy - they are often made of super-dense materials, and often still don't have articulation or joint protection. Again, we could consider that just an artistic liberty, but it is also fully in line with latter thicker armors sacrificing such fine details on favor of better chest and head protection.</p> <p>The second point is a more personal preference. Tamrielic cultures famously draw from a diverse set of historical and fictional inspirations. Reducing all of it only to a fixed European period world terribly restrict us. In the same way, restricting the inspirations for one of the Tamrielic cultures to a single IRL culture (the way ESO often does) wouldn't be the best way. Even the boring Skyrim's Nords are a mixture of iron age Scandinavia, 17th century Poland and Conan the Barbarian.</p> <p>The third point is about the linguistic aspect. It may look like that's a useless nerdy complaint about a fictional culture using the words with real-life etymology, which I usually find stupid. But I think it's a bit different for a lot of arms and armor etymology - most of it is artificial classification, using borrowed words to precisely pinpoint the shape and the cultural origin of a weapon. Like, otachi, miaodao and grossmesser mean basically 'big knife' in their respective language, and describe vaguely similar weapons. TES went away from using 'katana' or 'claymore' as in-game terms in favor of 'akaviri sword' and 'two-handed sword', and I believe it to be a good thing.</p> <p>Finally, to what I believe the general shape of arms and armors should be in the late Fourth Era. The 'technological progress' we have in the setting isn't exactly similar to any IRL historical period. The metallurgy didn't exactly improve - the idea that the ancient cultures had superior tech is a constant running theme. The destructive potential of the weapons isn't likely to progress much either - destruction magics have been a thing like forever. What the soul automation may do is allowing to mass-produce weapons and armor of medium quality in bigger amounts, and non-restricted global trade brings exotic materials everywhere. The character of combat is also less of pitched battles between big armies, and more of maritime conflicts, border disputes and trade route protection between professional and semi-professional units.</p> <p>So, roughly, I think it would make sense to be inspired by the IRL ~17th century without ripping it off completely. With full articulated heavy plate armors being restricted for siege or tournament use. Meanwhile, most of the armies use what would be a 'medium' kit of a torso protection and open helmet done with the use of rare and exotic materials. Steel and iron half-plate would still be used by guards and militias, and the 'light armors' would be the stuff used by the support units not likely to enter melee, and light cavalry. It would also make sense for the cultures to make a greater contact (despite, or even thanks to, the Empire being shattered). Thus, the iconic items of one culture or polity would be imported and recognized as 'exotic' while being used - Akaviri shortsword, Totambu saber, Resdayn bonemold - that should serve as specific weaponry terms instead of 'wakizashi' or 'scimitar'.</p> <p>Additional comments from u/Guinefort1:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scaling back armor to prioritize the torso and head follows the increasing power of firearms IRL, and matches both the Age of Sail motif and ironically modern military armor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scaling back armor makes sense for an Age of Sail because armor is both heavy and bulky. If there is limited space on a ship, less space for armor equals more space for other stuff.

Most of this will only be alluded to in-text, not stated outright.</p> <p>General Ideas:</p> <p>For Snow-Throat to exist, both the Empire and the Stormcloaks must fail. Both sides must be unable or unwilling to address the issues facing Skyrim, leading to the rejection or collapse of both.</p> <p>Stormcloak cause is the result of different causes aligning, not always perfectly. Religious (Talos), economic (planned Imperial destruction of Skyrim\u2019s economy), social/xenophobic, social/\u201dTrue Nord\u201d, aristocracy attempting to uphold privileges. Death of Talos removes religious, Stormcloak command is unable/unwilling to address economic (Stormcloaks rely on new extractive economy as much as Empire does - not enough incentive to change), leaving unpopular, divisive causes to be rejected by common folk.</p> <p>By the start of the game, the collapse is already underway. Hold capitals are already losing control of distant areas of holds, towns and villages are rejecting authority, trade is collapsing. Significant amounts of the populace have become displaced. The dragon crisis accelerates this.</p> <p>Timeline</p> <p>Pre-Skyrim:</p> <p>Imperial destruction of Skyrim\u2019s economy underway. Civil War occurring. Slow collapse as banditry becomes common, breakdown of trade.</p> <p>Civil War becomes a military stalemate. Whiterun remains neutral, and this neutrality is allowed due to the importance of Whiterun\u2019s food supply for both sides.</p> <p>4E201:</p> <ul> <li>Beginning of Skyrim. Ysimr appears. Following general \u201cminimalist run\u201d, Ysmir is only absolutely Thane of Whiterun with Lydia as housecarl and follower.</li> </ul> <p>Winter 4E201-Spring4E202:</p> <ul> <li>Treaty of High Hrothgar negotiates a peace between Empire and Stormcloaks. The actual details of this are unimportant vis a vis trading holds. This peace will hold, barring small, unofficial skirmishes.</li> </ul> <p>4E202:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Alduin defeated. Events of Dawnguard likely take place, but are not important in the long run. Ysimr\u2019s involvement not necessary, not touched on. Dawnguard and Volkihars both continue to exist after this. Other quests and plotlines occur.</p> </li> <li> <p>Continued deterioration of situation in Skyrim. Jarls begin jockeying for marriage to Elisif. Hero cults dedicated to Ysimr spring up and begin to spread. Revival of Nordic faith begins.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beginning of dragon diaspora/settlement. Blades and Ysmir begin hunting down dragons that continue attacking mortals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Last Dark Brotherhood sanctuary destroyed. Weeks later, Emperor Titus Mede II is assassinated while attending his cousin's wedding in Solitude.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4E203:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ysimr and Lydia go to Solstheim. Events of Dragonborn occur.</p> </li> <li> <p>24th Mid Year: Tibedetha Incident. Death of Talos, alleged ascension of Ysmir to godhood in revived Nordic faith as the true Dragonborn God and god of the mortal struggle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stormcloak cause begins to collapse. Widespread conversions to Nordic faith occur. Windhelm loses control of the Aalto. War declared on the Dominion by the Empire. Imperial forces begin to pull out of Skyrim, leaving behind small garrisons. Imperial forces bolstered by former Stormcloak veterans accepted under an unofficial policy of amnesty spearheaded by Legate Rikke. Ulfric Stormcloak and much of the Stormcloak\u2019s command structure rejoin the Legion and ship out.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jarl Skald of Dawnstar mysteriously dies in his sleep. Leaving behind no heirs, there is no direct successor. Dawnstar loses control of most of the Pale. A moot is formed to govern the city while a new jarl is selected.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4E204:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A revolutionary council forms in Windhelm to govern the city and what is left of the hold. The council and its supporters are wildly unpopular, representing the worst parts of the Stormcloak cause.</p> </li> <li> <p>Jarl Laila Law-Giver is deposed by Maven Black-Briar. Lacking direct Imperial support, usage of the Dark Brotherhood, or support from the Thieves Guild, Maven is dependent on thugs to enforce her rule. Price controls on food instituted by Maven in Riften.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bruma\u2019s chapel is reconsecrated as a temple of Ysmir.</p> </li> </ul> <p>At this point most holds are effectively independent of the hold capitals. Haafingar remains controlled by Solitude due to Imperial garrisons, but most cities only have direct control over their immediate surroundings. Long distance overland trade and communication is extremely unreliable outside of well-guarded routes. River and coastal trade remains moderately reliable, but trade from one end of the province to the other is rare.</p> <p>4E205:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An unusually harsh winter delays harvests and planting. This is the first sign of the cooling climate. Food riots in Windhelm when grain shipments from Whiterun are late. Disaffected war veterans, war orphans, and Dunmer begin forming alliances.</p> </li> <li> <p>Brina Merilis selected as jarl of Dawnstar with the support of Solitude. Merilis is forced to make concessions with the governing moot to become jarl and retain control of what remains of the hold.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Silver-Bloods depose Igmund as jarl of the Reach. Exiled to Solitude, Igmund never arrives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Beached ships near Winterhold are converted to semi-permanent buildings, signaling the start of what will become the port of New Winterhold.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4E206:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Another harsh winter further strains Skyrim. Riots in Windhelm become commonplace as the ruling council and supporters fight the populace. Argonian dockworkers, encouraged by An-Xileel agitators, break into the city and rampage through the Gray Quarter during the summer. Repulsed by an alliance of former Stormcloaks and Dunmer, the Argonians commandeer ships and sail south. River and coastal trade is crippled.</p> </li> <li> <p>Word of plague in the south reaches Skyrim. Mass exoduses from the cities begin.</p> </li> <li> <p>Riften\u2019s temple of Mara receives a new Dunmer priest.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4E207:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Plague in High Rock cuts off trade from the west.</p> </li> <li> <p>Intermittent trade to and from Morrowind in the eastern half of Skyrim brings the plague north.</p> </li> <li> <p>Plague infects Windhelm, begins to spread along river trade routes. Windhelm\u2019s council collapses.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Whiterun, Balgruuf orders the river closed at Valtheim Towers, asking for volunteers to man the towers and burn ships if necessary. While ultimately ineffective at stopping the spread of the plague, the decision delays and mitigates the impact of the plague upstream.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balgruuf abdicates as jarl and joins the exodus from Whiterun with his family and Irileth.</p> </li> <li> <p>The non-lycanthrope members of the Companions leave Whiterun, beginning the period of their history known as \u201cThe Wandering Years\u201d. The largest group coalesces around the leadership of Farkas and Vilkas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Falkreath\u2019s jarl and the commander of the Imperial garrison make the decision to establish a secure route to Solitude. Fighting their way north takes several months, establishing what will become known as the Legion Road. The Deepwoods Period of Solitude begins.</p> </li> </ul> <p>4E207 is commonly agreed to be the true end of Skyrim. In the west, the foundations of Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth appear with the establishment of the Legion Road and the seclusion of the royal court, while in the east the collapse of river trade, fragmentation of the Holds, and the collapse of the traditional aristocracy herald the beginning of the Snow-Throat Commonwealth.

The greater powers want to avoid outright war with each other, and sometimes use the lesser powers as proxies. Conflict should generally be about resources and political intrigue, not \"reclaiming the lost glories.\" While the details are always up for discussion on Discord or Reddit, and are usually described in specific chapter drafts, the big picture is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>The Potentate tries to scheme against Argonia and Freehold especially, against Resdayn, Anequina and Pelletine to a lesser degree. Sees the Commonwealth, Orsinium and Bloodtoil as ideological opponents, but doesn't act against them much. Low-key supports the Archdiocese as a buffer against that whole Colovian mess, and tries to play the Yokedate against Freehold. The best relations they have are with the League, GW&amp;K and Sapiarchy, as they are good trade partners with nothing to compete about.</li> <li>The League would be a bigger threat to everybody around, but their political system makes them better in defence and trade than in expansion. So their biggest beef is with Freehold. They also compete with Yokedate in trying to get to ancient Yokuda first.</li> <li>GW&amp;K has the most rocky relationships with the Commonwealth, but also the occasional border dispute with Druadach. They don't seem to have any special conflict with the League, as the League prefers to trade south, and GW&amp;K - north. So they are in good relationships with Resdayn and Potentate, and Archdiocese, and even Argonia. When the relationships with the Druadach are especially bad and with the League especially good, they blockade both Bjoulsae and Karth until the Reachmen start behaving.</li> <li>Many people fear the Yokedate, and allow the Bjoulsean hordes to proliferate to keep them in check.</li> <li>Orsinium has a good trade relationship with the Commonwealth, buying whale skeletons, and friendly relations due to the acceptance of Orcs as citizens. The part where Commonwealth Orcs are increasingly abandoning the old traditions grates on the more fundamentalist Orsinium Orcs. Potential for a breakdown in the future, but ok for the present.</li> <li>Argonia, Morrowind and the Potentate are basically in a three-way cold war at the moment, each being of the opinion that the other two hold territories that rightfully belong to them. In particular the Potentate view Argonia as a rising \"rival\" and a likely competitor for control of Topal Bay.</li> <li>The Ayleid Imperium are a \"developing nation\" heavily dependent on loans from the Tamrielic Bank of Z'en, i.e. the Republic and the Potentate, who see the Ayleids as basically their joint colony. The Ayleids want to conquer Bloodtoil and establish a port on that lucrative southern trade route. The Republic encourages this, mostly because they don't like having a bunch of uppity Beastfolk anarcho-primitivists in their backyard. Bloodtoil is backed by Anequina and Argonia, mostly to harass the Potentate's ambitions.

Some of them may seem to come into contradiction with each other. As following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Moon-sugar is a pretty significant Khajiit cultural and religious artifact, used not only in the cuisine, but in the spiritual practices. Some characterizations of it really seem to aim to remind of Dune's Spice, with all that 'natives eat it with food from childhood'. Skooma, which is much more potent, and addictive, and thus dangerous, is also sometimes controversially linked to Khajiit practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>One of the narratives around skooma positions it as a Dunmer corruption of Khajiit practices, and so aimed to raise the question of resource exploitation and all that area of colonial critique with various degrees of nuance. The allusions to the whole opium den in China and the British involvement is certainly implied.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the opium den analogy, the theme of addiction on the personal level is certainly touched.</p> </li> <li> <p>Both of the substances being restricted or outright forbidden in certain legal juridictions, they are both a great hook for the criminal plotlines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kirkbridean lore, including the OOC one had also used the theme of substance use (not only skooma, but joy-snow as well) just to drive harder the impression of the different world. I do not think it was for edginess, but rather to play up the legal and cultural differences, to evoke the feeling of historical novel set in the victorian age, or cyberpunk story, or anthropological essay.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, they are consumable items in the games, and so on addition to the descriptions, have actual mechanical effects. How all the effects between different descriptions do not match is a separate interesting question.</p> </li> </ol> <p>So, based on all of that, I propose to lean in the 'spiritual aid' side of the moon-sugar the hardest. Maybe that's a cowardly way out, but I'd say it doesn't cause physical dependency, but may cause psychological one.</p> <p>I like the Kirkbridean aesthetics of the alien-ness, and I certainly love our idea of cultural cross-pollination, so I would like for moon-sugar to be involved spiritual practices not only of the Khajiit people.</p> <p>I would say, moon-sugar may have comparatively mild 'ego death' effect, a slight disconnect between the spirit and the body, an out-of-body experience.</p> <p>Skooma is a tad trickier. The themes of both cultural corruption and criminal connection are both too iconic and important to loose. But my proposal is to lean more in the spiritual aspect as well. I'd say, skooma should be something like 'Fool's Chim', giving all that 'seeing tower from the side' trip, but without any real effect. Usually.</p> <p>So it is terribly addictive psychologically, especially for the people in hard times looking for the easy way out. For prepared practitioners though, it may be used to jump-start the enlightenment with careful preparation.</p> <p>And a separate topic is the legal and societal acceptance of both substances. When writing the Potentate Customs snippet, I've somehow already assumed the regulated, but not restricted character of moon-sugar. They may even treat skooma the same way, although with even more careful restrictions.</p>"},{"location":"Wiki/Design%20Docs/Technology/","title":"Technology","text":"<p>Overall, we are aiming for the \"Age of Exploration\" vibes of Redguard and Morrowind.

The Iliac League\u2019s version of the industry prefers \u201csympathetic\u201d souls (e.g. using an ox\u2019s soul to enchant a plow) and is considered \u201cquaint\u201d by the standards of other powers.</p> <p>-Military technology is \u201ctercio pike-and-spell\u201d. Powerful ballistae and spells exist in place of explosives. The Orcs of Orsinium have hot-air balloons. Most military technology is naval, given the focus on naval trade in this timeline\u2019s history.</p> <p>Other comments:</p> <ul> <li> <p>As described in the Cities of the Potentate. Port Katariah snippet, the Potentate dug out the old Reman-era designs. So while their labor laws put restrictions on how much soul energy is available for the immediate use, and everything looks vaguely Morrowind-level technologically, you can suddenly encounter space-age brutalist self-contained arcologies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Orsinium has what could probably be described as a blend of solarpunk, Da Vinci-esque clockpunk, Dwemer tech, and Orcish engineering. Very little of this is visible to outsiders, though, so to most Orsinium and Druadach seem to be roughly the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>The most basic summary of Orcish magitek engineering is that they collect magicka from the sun using moth-silk nets and use it to power magic circles and runes to produce effects. While efficient, this is also slow and works best at large scales - and as such these nets and the biggest magic circles can't be hidden. Fortunately, the nets double as water collectors and the largest spell circles can be used as navigation markers for airships and travelers, due to Orsinium's policy of not having signposts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Functionally, this means Orsinium's bunkers, tunnels, and places where outsiders don't go have lighting provided by magelight, air filtration, water pumps and heated water, and more, due to careful and clever usage of this magitek integrated with Dwemer designs. However, the scale and low flow of magicka doesn't lend well to large, continuous uses of magic - so no blast furnaces or the like.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whaleships and airships both draw from this system. Whaleships are built of moth-silk and whalebone to collect, store, and release energy to travel reality and keep their crews alive, and airships stay aloft by heating air magically. Both move via \"solar sails\" - using silk panels to capture streams of magicka and produce a push or pull effect.</p> </li> <li> <p>The spell circles and collected magicka form a multipurpose defensive net in and around Orsinium, as well as serving as a navigation beacon (an Ashpit-nomicon, if you will) and passive power source for those traversing the Ashpit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Orsinium's greatest achievement, however, is that they have teleported at least one and up to three whole mountains into the Ashpit as \"space stations\". In deliberate imitation of Umbriel, the Deep Orcs are attempting to turn these into self-sufficient cities, but they're hampered by their reliance on interdimensionally transmitted energy, the difficulty in setting up a self-contained ecosystem (no parasitic Hist trees here) and the lack of gravity. Only time will tell if they succeed, but for now they work just fine for whaleship ports and navigation aids.</p> </li> <li> <p>Snow-Throat is perhaps the nation most similar to the real-world in terms of mundane technology - which makes it something of a bizarre outlier to the rest of Tamriel. Yes, it is impressive that the northern barbarians have made mechanical contraptions to plow and thresh their fields - but it would be simpler to just soul-trap an oxen to a plow and have it do the work itself. Magic-fearing barbarians, pah!</p> </li> <li> <p>Snow-Throat's technology is not industrial but hovers somewhere around the 1700s to 1800s. Necessity begets invention, and the citizens of the Commonwealth found themselves needing as sea giant raids along the north coast drew militias and reserves away, draining manpower when it was needed for planting and harvests. In response, the Nordic and Orcish smiths began to innovate, producing contraptions that allow fewer people to do more work - plows, threshing machines, and more. Canals with locks have been constructed along rivers, reducing or removing the need for portaging crews. Of course, if a Clever Man were to be at hand with a feather spell or potion to enhance strength, no one would complain - tow lines must be hauled, after all. Windmills and sawmills work more efficiently than before, and engineers have reworked roads and bridges to better bear the weight of the mammoth merchants who wander the countryside.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unfortunately, there is no one set standard across the Commonwealth for the construction of these devices. The smiths of Whiterun have settled on one standard for parts and production, Riften another, Ivarstead has it's own set of measures, Windhelm yet another, and the College of Old Winterhold, in their attempt to create a set standard, created yet another competing standard. The Great Moot will occasionally hear arguments from proponents of one or another standard, yet has decided that it has no power over this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alchemy, and what we might consider forms of chemistry, has become widely accepted and proliferated, in no small part because of the proliferation of crossbows and alchemical bolts in Snow-Throat, where it is sometimes said that children can operate a crank before they can walk. This cottage industry of bolt production has lead to advances in food preservation as well - frost salts to refrigerate food, dashes of herbs to sanitize water and stave off rot, clever treatments to drive away pests. Others have found ways to modify the soil in beneficial ways (and occasionally in harmful ways as well).</p> </li> <li> <p>However, these advancements have yet to spread far. Even inside Snow-Throat, some of these mechanical contraptions are limited in use outside of where they were designed - plows that excel in the plains of Whiterun struggle in the heavily rooted soils of Ilinalta Hold, for instance, to say nothing of Orsinium or Druadach. The barons of Rorikstead have rebuffed offers of sale, claiming that they have other ways to ensure bountiful harvests, and yet farther afield the soul-magic of foreigners dominates. Yet Snow-Throat continues - after all, while one may occasionally lose fingers to pulleys and belts, that's still a better deal than being doomed to the Fields of Regret.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wiki/Design%20Docs/Witches%2C%20Wyrds%2C%20and%20Druids/","title":"Witches, Wyrds, and Druids","text":"<p>Some confusion arose in the writer team over how to handle the issue of conflicting lore surrounding these seemingly-overlapping group.

The plague's roots begin with Peryite's Afflicted in Skyrim in 4e201, being used as a petri dish of sorts to develop the plague, before spreading out across Tamriel. This fact is not known in-universe, as the plague's true spread began in the south during the Second Great War. </p> <p>The Second Great War acted as a super spreader event, as battles in the south caused plague to be spread across Valenwood, Elsweyr, and the Blackwood, before spreading through trade routes around the continent. Skyrim was likely the last place the plague reached from both east and west, as the collapse of sea travel slowed the spread.</p> <p>At some point during the height of the Plague, Sload arrived in Tamriel with cures, trading them for land and citizenship.</p> <p>Due to the natural resistance of Argonians to disease, Black Marsh was less affected by the Plague than other regions.</p> <p>Some areas, like the Imperial City, were affected worse and lost more of their population, than others. 1/3 to 1/2 is an average of the entire continent, not a hard rule for everywhere.</p> <p>Symptoms and Spread  * Fever, vomiting, eventual coma and death. Skin will take on a silvery tone, giving the Plague its name.  * Highly contagious and lethal. Will kill in most but not all cases. Likely airborne?  * Likely performs better in warmer, more humid climates than cooler, drier areas.</p> <p>Cures and Treatment  * Sload have some form of cures.  * Restoration and Alchemy likely effective to some extent.

Rather, many factors came together at roughly the same time to create a perfect storm.</p> <p>First, the Silver Plague abruptly cut off trade continentwide. Ships from the south abruptly stopped coming to the ports of the north, and this stoppage caused a collapse in the local economies. Residents left the cities for the countryside, businesses collapsed, and ports lay idle.</p> <p>Second, the Silver Plague, when it reached the north, depopulated the cities and surrounding region even more. After the plague receded, the northern coast was low on manpower, short on industry and functioning ports, and left with a primarily rural population.</p> <p>Together, these would not have been fatal long-term. Populations can recover, cities be rebuilt, ports open again. But alas, these were not the only things to occur.</p> <p>The warm-water current that passes along the north coast abruptly weakened for a time beginning in the late 4E200's, causing the region to become cooler. A region already struggling was plunged into a crisis, as crops in High Rock - today's Greater Wrothgar &amp; Karth - failed and starvation ran rampant. While the warm water current eventually strengthened - but not to what it had been - culturally, the transition of the kingdom to an agricultural land was complete. The lands that make up today's Commonwealth, already used to the cold, were less afflicted. </p> <p>Finally, and perhaps related to the weakened water current, the Sea of Ghosts has become much icier. Great icebergs often drift south from Atmora, likely from glaciers just reaching the sea. </p> <p>Put together, the lack of support, fewer viable ports, and more dangerous waters encouraged traders to seek alternative routes around the continent. Ships now sail south, passing through ports along the coast of Argonia, a growing and prosperous state.</p> <p>This is not to say that no one sails the north.

May also tax mages who do not act with Temple sanction. Various \"sword-cults\" persist in the Yokedate military, some in defiance of the main religion.

Japanese and Ottoman inspirations.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Satakal is perceived as an impersonal force above even the gods, much like Anu. He is Creation and Destruction and doesn't much care for mortals and lesser spirits. At most he is Fate incarnate. So he is hardly prayed to.

There are also rumors of him recruiting the rogue members of both Morag Tong and the Dark Brotherhood as his personal secret police.</p> <p>What concerns the religion, the Potentate flaunts the idea of the Nibenese tolerance and religious pluralism - and works to appease the sizable non-Imperial populations, the biggest of them Dunmer and Khajiit. Formally, the Potentate accepts the religious authority of the Archdiocese, but in practice it has an even more pantheist bent. Two other dominant creeds flow from the [[Chapel of Arkay]] in Cheydinhal (which merged seamlessly with the ancestor worship) and [[Chapel of Mara]] in Bravil which took the ideal of apotheosis to almost the Velothic heights. In the practical implementation it means a multitude of small local cults and creeds of Avatars, Saints and Ancestors - the veritable land of the Thousand Cults.</p> <p>The interaction of the moving forces of the Potentate results in a very peculiar legal system where the laws have unexpected motivations. For example, the practice of necromancy and black soul gem trade are restricted under the labor laws, while the consumption of Moon-sugar and Skooma are permissable as religious practices.</p> <p>Speaking of the influences, the Potentate calls back to the Nibenay of the PGE 1 and mixes the Far Eastern vibes (hierarchical bureaucracy, structure of the religions), Bysantine ones, and a touch of Bas-Lag.</p> <p>Sources: Chapter.

The traditional aristocracy and nobility is gone, replaced by a system of moots, voting, and individual representation. Elected local moots govern towns and villages, elected Hold moots govern holds, and the elected Great Moot and elected Jarls and High King govern the nation - or at least, govern as much as the people will let them. Monasteries of voice-using Dragon Monks, Dragon-monks, and Dragons dot the landscape, wandering monks, mystics and hermits travel the wilderness, and militias of citizen-soldiers armed with alchemical crossbows protect the land from sea-giant raids, Falmer incursions, vampire attacks, and more.</p> <p>Snow-Throat draws from early American history, especially the Articles of Confederation, when the federal government was weak and democracy was strong. The nation is one of the more developed technologically in the setting, but is still schizotech - Renaissance to pre-Industrial Revolution tech exists alongside Viking longships transported in canals, crossbow-armed militias comparable to the Marines of the Malazan setting and American minutemen, etc.</p> <p>Magically, Snow-Throat lags behind most other nations - while magic is far more accepted than it was in Skyrim, Snow-Throat's institutions are regarded as hidebound and traditional and the common mage unrefined. Religiously, the Commonwealth has a revived but very syncretic faith based largely off of the old Nordic pantheon, while the Giants hold mostly to their old ways and the Dragon Monks practice a bizarre form of Neo-Ysmirism. Primary inspirations are early American history, Skyrim, and Malazan.</p>"},{"location":"Wiki/Polities/Yokedate/","title":"Yokedate","text":"<p>After the Plague and the wholesale secession of the mostly traditionally Forebear coastal cities to the Iliac League, the Na-Totambu part of the Hammerfell is left to figure out their unifying idea outside of the traditional confrontation.</p> <p>The power is structured in the curiously overlapping way, where the Emperor is the head of the traditional religion, . The executive and military power meanwhile belongs to the military governors - Yokedas, led by the Elder Yokeda. Formally, he is appointed by the Emperor, in reality, the Army is a self-ruling body, and only presents the candidates for appointment. But this convinient fiction has not being broken yet.</p> <p>The day-to-day functioning of the land is overseen by the mostly elected magistrates and tribal chiefs, who have little influence on the structure above them.</p> <p>The idea of what the Yokedate should be is also seen differently by the different factions - the Emperor wishes for the full restoration of the traditional Redguard religion, while the 'Young Redguard' faction in the military pushes for the cultural and linguistic approach, and had recently reintroduced the half-forgotten Yoku to the wider usage.</p> <p>This faction calls back to the Hammerfell as presented in the Redguard, and the Japanese-influences themes of the Daggerfall lore, with the tension between the Emperor and the Yokedas inspired both by the Emperor-Shogun one, and Middle-Eastern Calif-Emir one. The idea of the role of the language is inspired by the Ataturk reforms of the early 20th century Turkey.</p>"},{"location":"Wiki/Technology%20and%20Magic/Moon-sugar/","title":"Moon sugar","text":"<p>A ritual and recreative substance, obtained from the Elsweyr cane grass.
