The Reachfolk have taken control of most of the historical Reach from Evermore to Dragonstar to Markarth and beyond. They are ruled by a hereditary Ard, who can be challenged for their title by any of the many clan chiefs. The Ards try to navigate the complex task of bringing their society to the technomagical level of the other nations while staying true to their ancient culture. The main divide is cultural ("Imperialized" urban clans vs "Wilder" mostly nomadic clans vs conquered non-Reachfolk), and religious with the crown sponsoring a syncretic religion that presents the most popular divinities of the various groups as being "guises" of the same primordial gods (Zenithar, Tsun, Hircine, Zeht and the spirit of Faolan all being "the Tricky Hunter" for example) with middling results.

Due to the Reach's bloody history they sees themselves as beset by ennemies (not completely false) and in order to compete with their rivalss own magic (e.g. the Voice) they make a liberal use of briarhearts, werebeasts and hagravens, and are trying to form diplomatic ties with the Falmer (the last three being rather controversial). Their population is mostly Reachfolk, with significant Orc, Breton, Nord, Redguard and Cyrodiilic minorities. The main inspirations are TES V and Online as well as Celts.
