The main Summerset Isle, whose population is mostly Altmer and Goblin. Officially governed by the “Sapiarchs,” a bunch of wizard-lords and academics. They mostly prefer internal politicking and ivory-tower debate to actually governing, though. Most of the country is actually led by anarchistic communes inspired by the Beautiful of PGE3 + the House of Reveries from ESO, with heavy emphasis on self-governance and continual self-reinvention. In parts where the Sapiarchy does have control, the influence is Soviet-esque bureaucracy and central planning. [[Shimmerene]] is the only place where some small semblance of Thalmor ideology survives, mainly in a would-be dictator combining revolutionary aesthetics with Alinori nationalism and militarism with results that are likely to be disastrous for everyone involved. And yes, Goblins are now full citizens with equal rights. At least in the communes.

Religiously, the Elder Way of the Psijics is dominant in Alinor, though in various ways. To most outsiders the Alinori have become so intellectual in their faith as to border on atheism, but actually it is more like Neoplatonism through the lens of ancestor worship and a heavy emphasis on returning to the One (Anu). (Though not in the conspiracy theorist “Altmer want to destroy the world” sort of way). For the artists in the communes some Vehkian and Mankariite influence has crept in, because of course it has.
