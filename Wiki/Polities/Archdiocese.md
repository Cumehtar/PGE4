Following the Fall of the Empire, the former Imperial City, now mostly known by its ancient name of [[Cyrodiil City]], and the surrounding lake Rumare came under the control of the Imperial Cult and its leader the Primate of Akatosh/Archbishop of the One, ruling from the Temple of the One. Large sections of the City have been abandoned or converted to urban farms, as the population has not recovered from the [[Silver Plague]] and the lost of its "capital of the world" status. The abandoned sections serve as hiding places for outlaws, goblins and strange cults. The White-Gold Tower is inhabited by a flight of dragons who made a deal with the Archbishop.

The power of the Archdiocese rests in the Imperial Cult which is still very present throughout Tamriel, especially among humans (and indeed the seven other Primates live in Colovia, the Potentate and Anequina), although the priesthood's gradual slide towards Alessian Order-style worship of "the One" is starting to cause issues, as does the schism with the Primate of Akatosh/Chaplain of Auri-El in [[Kvatch]].

The population is largely made of Cyrodiils, especially outside of the city proper, but the priesthood and leadership is more diverse as faithful from all over the continent can rise in ranks. The main inspiration is the Papal States and Isaac Asimov's Trantor (itself a sci-fi version of post Roman Empire Rome).
