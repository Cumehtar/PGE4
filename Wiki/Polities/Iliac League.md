The heavily urbanized area around the Iliac Bay was one of the most affected by the plague. But the inhabitants didn't flee the cities to the hills, instead they hunkered and persisted. The final fall of the Empire, the devastation of Colovia, the loss of the contact between the cities - all that buried the old dream of uniting the region under one ruler for good.

Instead, the League is a loose alliance of the city-states, and each of those has its own political system, a particular way the citizen-knights decide on the important issues.

In their attempts to rebuild, the enchanters of the Bay pavedc the way to the modern techniques of the industrial [[Enchanting]]. But by now their approach is seen as quaint and outdated, with symbolic elements no longer deemed necessary - spirits of the horses enchanting the self-moving plows in the field, spiders used for the silk spinning machines.

As for the influences, first is obviously the fragmented Iliac Bay of the pre-Miracle of Peace times. And where the Freehold takes from the Renaissance Mediterranean, Iliac League rather calls back to the ancient Greek polities, with the ideal of free warrior-citizens and agora. Polish voting gentry can be seen as one more inspiration, although due to the widespread enchanted mechanisms and the post-factum depopulation, the proportion of the full-rights citizens to the rest is less drastic.
