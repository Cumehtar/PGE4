If you want a medieval fantasy state, GW&K is there for you. Born of an unexpected marital alliance of the Queens of the Western Skyrim and Rivenspire, the region was the most affected by the decline of the trade over the Sea of Ghosts. Together with the plague, it caused an almost total depopulation of the cities of the region. The land is a fractured landscape of rural thane-baronies ruled by the descendants of the old Legion garrisons, only tentatively controlled from the rebuilding city of Solitude.

Religiously, the kingdom preserved the old Septim-era worship (bar the cult of Talos) in an almost untouched state. While nominally accepting the primacy of the Archdiocese, the Temple of the Eight Divines spread over the whole city quarter, including the Castle Dour, and converted it into the prime theological educational institution of the North.

Influence-wise, GW&K takes the most stereotypical 'medieval European fantasy' elements of Daggerfall, Oblivion and Skyrim, and tries to give them a 'convergent evolution' explanation in the world.
