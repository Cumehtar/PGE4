The six ruling patrician families of the [[Freehold Republic]], whose power was won through spiritual, dynastic, and economic hegemony. Most families in the Freehold Republic find themselves somehow entangled to the Six Families. Each claims descent, either literally or metaphorically, from a patron Aedra who colors their "personality." They are:

The Adariels, whose patron deity is Xarxes.

The Elsinors, whose patron deity is Phynaster.

The Camorans, whose patron deity is Jephre.

The at-Reymons, whose patron deity is Reymon Ebonarm.

The Umbranoxes, whose patron deity is Dibella.

The Shraj, whose patron deity is Zen/ithar.
