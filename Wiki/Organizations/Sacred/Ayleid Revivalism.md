Not an organized faith as such, but a shorthand for the strange variety of faiths that have appeared in and around the New Ayleid Imperium. As the Imperium is technically a theocracy, the _adoni_ (Ayleidoon for "lords"; the ruling class), are each the Head of Faith for their particular domain. North of the Strid river, in Colovia, they mostly keep to worship of Anuic beings like Magnus and the Eight. Meridia is also acceptable under their framework. Southwards, Daedric gods like Azurah (among the Khajiit), Hermaeus Mora, and Dagon might show up. The "Dawnway" is popular among Bosmer Ayleids, a sort of compromise with the Green Pact that doesn't break its tenets but re-orients focus on the Heavenly Gods. Influences are somewhat Roman and Babylonian, with the emphasis on stars and astral bodies.

Preferred terminology: the leaders are the Adoni, but they leave much of the actual "church-work" to the Chaplains, another class of rulers, who in turn have various clerks and disciples working for them. Kvatch is special, as its religious leader is both a Chaplain in the Imperium and the Primate of Auri-El (excommunicated by the Archdiocese).
