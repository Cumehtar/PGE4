The Emperor of Old Hammerfell is attempting to resurrect and "purify" the religion of Yokuda, possibly with the aid of the old tribes. Not all the tribes want to go along, and not all citizens are ready to give up the Tamrielic deities. So temples and churches to "foreign gods" have to pay an extra tax. May also tax mages who do not act with Temple sanction. Various "sword-cults" persist in the Yokedate military, some in defiance of the main religion. Satakal and Ruptga are the "chief" deities, but distant and abstract. Tu'whacca more prominent, followed by Morwha, Tava, and Zeht. Large variety of spirits and gods for everything. Japanese and Ottoman inspirations.

- Satakal is perceived as an impersonal force above even the gods, much like Anu. He is Creation and Destruction and doesn't much care for mortals and lesser spirits. At most he is Fate incarnate. So he is hardly prayed to. The Emperor's role as High Priest then would be less about interceding with him or carrying his will but enacting the proper rituals to maintain cosmic order.
    
- Tall Papa is one step removed on the ladder of unknowableness. As the progenitor of the gods and the creator of the Walkabout he is worshipped as the originator of Law and proper conduct. But as he turned away from the World in disgust he is seen as harsh and distant and only prayed to for the most important of occasions.
    
- Tu'whacca I feel would then be the most popular deity as shown by the importance of funeral rites to the Redguards and VoF stating that Arkay gains prominence in those cultures where Akatosh becomes to abstract. I think he would be seen as Ruptga's emissary to the mortals as the one who showed them how to still reach the Far Shores.
    
- Morwha, Tava and Zeht would be the next most popular deities and the one most relevant to everyday concerns.
    
- Onsi, Leki, Hoo Ding and Diagna would be the most popular among the army for obvious reasons. ESO says that the traditional crown of the High King is "the Diadem of Diagna", and while I'm 80% sure that's just for the alliteration, I think there's something to bé done there.
    
- I think Redguard religion includes a host of hyperspecialized gods, like the god-of-writing-love-poems, the god-of-washing-in-the-morning, the god-of-washing-in-the-evenig, the god-of-horse-rearing, etc. Etc. Who are seen as servants of those and don't necessarily have their own temples but are prayed to whenever they're relevant.

Preferred terminology: the Yokudan word for temple is "bologra." Priests and high priests all answer ultimately to the Emperor, aka the [[Sheklith]], who acts as the Head of Faith.
