The main faith of the [[Archdiocese]] (obviously), quite popular throughout former Cyrodiil. Evolved from the former Imperial Cult, it sees all deities and saints as ultimately "faces"or "emanations" of the One, and so implicitly accepts all faiths. It is led by the [[Archbishop]] of the One in the Cyrodiil City, who meets with the [[Council of Eight]] (one [[Primate]] from each major city in former Cyrodiil). Each Primate differs in doctrine somewhat. Inspired by by Hindu pantheism and the Papal States.

Preferred terminology: Highest leaders are "Primates," who are members of the leading Council. Other names likely derived from the [Imperial Cult faction ranks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Imperial_Cult), though that could be subject to change. Buildings can be chapels, cathedrals, abbeys, temples, and priories.
