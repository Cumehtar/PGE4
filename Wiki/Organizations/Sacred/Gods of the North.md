Scandinavian polytheism vibes with mild pseudo-Catholic undercurrent in more organized temples. Technically a revival and evolution of the Nordic faith with mild syncretism with old Imperial practices. "Organized" form coexists with the widespread folk practices.

Kyne's organized temple is in Whiterun, with holy sites across the Commonwealth. Other major sites include Kynesgrove, the Eldergleam, and the 7000 Steps/Throat of the World.

Mara's Temple is in Riften.

Dibella's Temple and Sybil moved to Windhelm.

Ysmir's Temple in Bruma. Folk forms most common in former Skyrim.

Jhunal, Orkey, Mora have Shrines in College of Old Winterhold. Orkey invoked in burial sites/halls of the dead/family tombs as well.

Stuhn/Tsun have no single organized temple.

Magnar worship widespread. Hermitage site in Saarthal, but the hermits are so good at hiding no one has ever seen them.

Preferred terminology: Priests/Priestesses typically go by Brother, Sister, Father, or Mother. Terms are sometimes literal.
