The blame for collapse of trade along Tamriel's north coast cannot be laid at the feet of any one cause. Rather, many factors came together at roughly the same time to create a perfect storm.

First, the Silver Plague abruptly cut off trade continentwide. Ships from the south abruptly stopped coming to the ports of the north, and this stoppage caused a collapse in the local economies. Residents left the cities for the countryside, businesses collapsed, and ports lay idle.

Second, the Silver Plague, when it reached the north, depopulated the cities and surrounding region even more. After the plague receded, the northern coast was low on manpower, short on industry and functioning ports, and left with a primarily rural population.

Together, these would not have been fatal long-term. Populations can recover, cities be rebuilt, ports open again. But alas, these were not the only things to occur.

The warm-water current that passes along the north coast abruptly weakened for a time beginning in the late 4E200's, causing the region to become cooler. A region already struggling was plunged into a crisis, as crops in High Rock - today's Greater Wrothgar & Karth - failed and starvation ran rampant. While the warm water current eventually strengthened - but not to what it had been - culturally, the transition of the kingdom to an agricultural land was complete. The lands that make up today's Commonwealth, already used to the cold, were less afflicted. 

Finally, and perhaps related to the weakened water current, the Sea of Ghosts has become much icier. Great icebergs often drift south from Atmora, likely from glaciers just reaching the sea. 

Put together, the lack of support, fewer viable ports, and more dangerous waters encouraged traders to seek alternative routes around the continent. Ships now sail south, passing through ports along the coast of Argonia, a growing and prosperous state.

This is not to say that no one sails the north. Many do, having learned to navigate the near-piratical mess of the Commonwealth, or are traders from the Commonwealth itself, for whom rough, icy seas and barren coasts are simply a fact of life.
